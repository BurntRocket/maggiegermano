*This is part three for June's theme of money and how it relates to our loved ones. Check out part [one](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/financially_prepare_for_family_occasions/) and [two](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-stop-trying-to-keep-up-with-the-joneses/)!*

I bet you talk more openly with your friends about your sex life than your money life. Am I right? Somehow it's more comfortable to discuss what's happening between the sheets than what's happening in our bank accounts. 

I really believe it's time to change that! Why? If we could learn how to talk about money with our friends, we would all be a lot better off. We'd feel less embarrassed about spending less at the bar, or staying in more often.  Our friends would know our financial goals, and we would feel more supported.

I'm not saying that you should walk around bragging about how much money you have or screaming about how much debt you're in. (Though, if that's cathartic for you, go for it.)
