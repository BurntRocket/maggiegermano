Happy Friday! Here's what I've been up to this week!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* The fees from the February Money Circle deposited into my account this week. ([Sign up](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-taxes-fit-into-your-financial-goals/) for next month's gathering!)

* One of my monthly coaching clients paid for March early.

* We had three Airbnb guests over the past week, and their fees are depositing into our bank account soon.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* I tried really hard not to spend money this week. I'm sure you understand how the last few days of the month can be tight. If I get close to my budget limit, I try not to spend money again until the 1st of the next month. However, I did spend a few dollars on tea at a coffee shop, and about $15 at Home Depot (of course).

## What I'm Writing

Financial tasks, like filing your taxes, can be incredibly stressful. It's easy to avoid doing the things that stress us out the most. So [I wrote this week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-get-to-your-happy-place-before-doing-your-taxes/) about how to get into your happy place before you tackle your taxes. 

## What I'm Excited About

* I'm spending this weekend with the amazing folks at [CoachDiversity Institute](http://coachdiversity.com/). I received my coaching certification through them last year, and now I'm training to be a trainer for their program. Their mission is to bring the transformational power of coaching to all communities. If you want to learn more, [email me](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com)!

* Women's History Month! We should be celebrating women every single day, but I'm looking forward to a month full of elevating the contributions of women throughout history. Stay tuned!

## What I'm Fan-Girling Over

* [Marcella Kriebel](https://marcellakriebel.com/)'s food-themed artwork. We already own two: an [avocado](https://www.etsy.com/listing/525379595/ripe-avocado-watercolor-illustration-art?ref=shop_home_active_38) and a [bread assortment](https://www.etsy.com/listing/220227439/bread-for-all-art-illustration-w-nelson?ref=shop_home_active_85). I'd love to fill up the wall in my kitchen with these, and the next one I want is [this one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/568819811/large-bowl-of-ramen-with-egg-nori-and) that makes my mouth water.

* [The Kettering Incident](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4228802/). Dan and I just started watching this Australian show on Amazon Prime recently. It's really creepy. We *think* it's about aliens, but we aren't sure yet.

## Money Tips to Take Into the Weekend

* Take advantage of a free event in your city. Better yet, try to find something that you've never tried before. You won't be spending any money *and* you'll be trying something new.

* Review the benefits provided by your employer. Are you taking advantage of a 401k match that's offered? Are you using pre-tax commuter benefits?
