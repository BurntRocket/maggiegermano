Like many Americans, you may have received your stimulus check via direct deposit already. If you haven't yet received your deposit, or if you will get the money via check, visit this [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments) to get an update on your money. The site also gives you the opportunity to input your bank information so that you can get your money via direct deposit. The system has been pretty overloaded, so if it takes a couple of tries, or if you get an error message, keep at it.

## Cover Your Necessities

The most important thing to do is make sure that you and your family have what they need to survive. 

## Pay Your Bills

The main reason we are even getting these stimulus checks is to tide us over during this crisis. The idea is that people will be using this money to pay their bills and cover their necessities

## Pad Your Savings

If you don't have an emergency fund, or if you have one but it's small, you should use as much of this money as possible to help fund your savings. If COVID-19 doesn't show everyone why an emergency fund is so important, I don't know what will.
