Hopefully you know how important retirement savings is. Most Americans can no longer rely on pensions or Social Security when we get to retirement age. And we're typically living a lot longer than generations before us. So it's up to us to save our own money. But the different types of retirement accounts can be confusing, which can hold us back from getting started. So here are a few of the most comment retirement accounts and the differences between them. With this information, you can decide which accounts are available and/or right for you.

## 401k

A 401k is a retirement plan that is set up by an employer for individual employees.

The annual contribution limit for a 401k is $18,500. Many of us don't necessarily have to worry about reaching that limit in a year, but it does help you in the long run to max it out. You shouldn't worry about opening a separate IRA until after you've started maxing out your 401k.

## 403b

A 403b is a retirement plan that is set up for employees by organizations like public schools, non-profits, and religious groups.

The annual contribution limit for a 403b is $18,500, just like for a 401k. As I mentioned above, you should max out this account before you start contributing to an IRA. 

## Roth IRA

"IRA" stands for "individual retirement account". Anyone can open an IRA, whether or not they are employed. 

The annual contribution limit for an IRA is $5,500. This total amount applies even if you have more than one IRA. You cannot contribute more than $5,500, no matter how many IRA accounts you have.

## Traditional IRA

## SEP IRA
