## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Oh boy, where should I start? This week has been pretty expensive on the homeownership front. On Monday, we got our air ducts cleaned. They were so dirty after years of never being cleaned that they ended up needing to sanitizing them, which more than doubled the cost. On Tuesday, we had the ducts sealed to reduce air leakage by more than 80%.
