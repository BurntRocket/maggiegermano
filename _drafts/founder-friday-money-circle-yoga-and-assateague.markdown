Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my new clients paid for their first month of financial coaching.

* One of my retainer clients paid their monthly fee.

* We had an Airbnb guest arrive yesterday.

* Dan's bi-weekly paycheck came in yesterday.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Again, we're trying to keep our spending down this month, since we have a lot of big expenses coming up in the next few months. However, Dan pulled money from his savings account to buy himself a pottery wheel from someone near Ocean City. It's his first step towards creating a home pottery studio eventually.

* Since we were so close to Ocean City, we decided to drive a little bit further and visit Assateague Island for the first time. It was so beautiful there! It was cool seeing the ponies hanging around the marshes and walking down the street. We paid $20 to get into the national park area of the island. We also bought lunch and some snacks for the long drive home. Bruno had a great time running around on the beach. We definitely plan to go back and spend more than just a couple of hours there.

* On Wednesday, I bought myself from snacks from Target while I was downtown all day for meetings. I also bought snacks for the Money Circle meetup that was held that night.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about how damaging it can be to constantly [compare yourself to others](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/comparing-yourself-to-others-means-youll-never-feel-satisfied/). I also included some tips on how to stop doing that so much.

## **What I’m Up To**

* Not only am I launching a podcast, but I've also created a **[Money Circle membership program](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)**. This program will allow you to be engaged with Money Circle no matter where you live. You'll get access to the in-person meetups, participate in group coaching calls, and/or get monthly access to me. **[Sign up today](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)**!

* I'm leading a [personal finance workshop](https://generalassemb.ly/education/money-matters-get-financially-savvy-in-the-upcoming-year/washington-dc/81133) at General Assembly in DC on Wednesday, August 28th. It's FREE, and it'll be fun!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* Did I mention I'm launching the [Money Circle podcast](https://moneycircle.simplecast.com/) next week? The introductory episode is already up on [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/money-circle/id1476319828?l) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5XIJDpfL2UJTExmSeGGxXJ?si=rDbRrSjISjylrEwL4Qlj3w), so please make sure to subscribe, rate, and review!

## **What I’m Reading**

I'm still working my way through the [Sawbones book](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Sawbones-Book/Justin-McElroy/9781681883816). It's a big book with small writing and lots of extra information in the edges. So it's taking me a while to get through it, but I'm intent on finishing it before this weekend ends. 

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
