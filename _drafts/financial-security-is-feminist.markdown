For me, financial security is not just about money. It's not about having more money so that you can have more stuff. It's about having more money so that you have more freedom, more security, more independence. To me, pursuing financial security is a deeply feminist act. It's why I decided to become a financial coach for women. I want to help women get control over their money so that they can have the lives they really desire. I want them to use money as a tool of empowerment, rather than it being a source of stress and anxiety. Here are just a few ways that financial security can help you to live a feminist life.

## Reproductive Freedom

Abortion and birth control are legal in the United States, regardless of what some legislators seem to think. However, legality does not equal accessibility. If a woman is uninsured and low-income, odds are that she can't afford her own birth control. This increases the likelihood that she will have an unintended pregnancy. From there, if she decides that she doesn't want to keep the pregnancy, she has to go through many hoops.

Having access to money in this kind of scenario leads to much different outcomes. Even when abortion was illegal in the United States, women of means were able to access safe abortion.

## The Ability to Leave

A big reason that I was attracted to financial coaching was so that I could help women who might otherwise feel trapped. Money is a huge factor in abusive relationships. Ninety-eight percent of abusive relationships involve [financial abuse](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/financial-abuse-survivors-want-you-to-know).

The ability to leave a bad situation can apply to many areas of life. Bad relationships, bad roommate situations, and bad jobs.

See this story about why you should have a ["fuck off fund"](https://www.thebillfold.com/2016/01/a-story-of-a-fuck-off-fund/) and how it applies to your career.

## Control Over Your Decisions

I want women to get their money right so that they have the power to make basic decisions in their lives. 

## The Power to Speak Up

If the #MeToo movement taught me anything, it's that money and success are so often used as a weapon against women. Many women who were harassed or assaulted by Harvey Weinstein (and so many others) felt unable to speak up because he held their career in his hands.

This is striking when you think about lower-income women who are harassed and abused. They often can't speak up because they and their families need the income from their jobs. Abusers know this and target people accordingly.

## The Means to Donate to a Cause

Many of my clients talk about wanting to be able to give money to their favorite causes. They hope to someday have enough discretionary income to give freely to organizations they support. Giving money is a great way to support the things you care about most. It's a real, tangible way to make an impact. Having extra money to build philanthropy into your budget allows you to speak up in ways you might not otherwise be able to.
