Almost two weeks ago now, I attended my fourth [FinCon](https://finconexpo.com/). It's an annual conference where financial professionals and brands come together to learn from each other and make relationships. I first attended when I was merely six months into being a financial coach, and this year is the first time that I felt like I actually knew a lot of people and could help educate others. In fact, I was on a panel about remaining authentic while building a financial coaching business. Needless to say, it was a whirlwind four days and I was pretty exhausted (in a good way) afterwards. One of my biggest takeaways, though, was a keynote speech that I didn't think I would actually enjoy.

[Ramit Sethi](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/) was one of the opening keynote speakers for FinCon on Thursday, September 5th. I've never followed Ramit's work very closely, after being turned off by his abrasive approach to financial advice years ago. I actually considered skipping his talk in favor of chatting with friends or grabbing breakfast. But I'm glad that I stayed, because Ramit gave a great talk that had fantastic takeaways for all of us in the audience.

## Making a Home

Yesterday marked two years since Dan and I signed the papers to close on our home. Two years since we officially became homeowners! Honestly, time has flown by and a lot has changed. When we first bought the house, it needed quite a bit of work. We bought it knowing that we were going to have to spend a lot of money to make it what we wanted it to be

## Healthy Food

This category isn't always something I prioritized in my life. In fact, I used to go grocery shopping once every two weeks and I would buy things like white rice and frozen corn so that I could get the most food for the least amount of money. I was also 22 years old and new to Washington, DC, so I didn't have a lot of money and also wasn't very worried about my health. Things are changed dramatically since then. Now, I feel strongly about buying only organic produce and animal products.
