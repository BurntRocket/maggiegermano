Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* I'm speaking at [ISL](https://isl.co/) next week, and the payment for the gig went through this week.

* We had Airbnb guests nonstop this week, which has been going really well. We had a solid core door installed in the basement stairwell and it has helped a lot with dampening the sounds coming from the Airbnb.  

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I bought a bunch of random wedding items this week. We're buying matching necklaces and neck ties for our bridal party and parents, so I purchased all of those.

* We also each bought some water shoes for our honeymoon. We'll likely be doing quite a bit of swimming and snorkeling, and I personally always feel more comfortable if I have something sturdy on my feet. 

* I have found myself walking to the store most days this week to buy sweet snacks. I have a pretty infamous sweet tooth, but this week it has been even more so. So I spent more than I want to admit on snacks.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about why it's important to spend money on things that make you happy. It can actually make it easier for you to stick to a budget! [Check it out.](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/why-spending-money-on-happy-is-worth-it/)

## **What I’m Up To**

* I was quoted in [Martha Stewart Weddings](https://www.marthastewartweddings.com/641372/should-you-go-into-debt-for-wedding) this week! I talked about how important it is to not go into debt for your wedding. Check it out!

* I’m speaking at [Robert Morris University](https://www.rmu.edu/) next weekend! There was a last minute cancelation at one of their orientation events, so I’m filling in to talk about money. I’m hoping to do more events like this, because it’s important to get your money right from a young age, and I want to reach women in college! So if you know of any universities who are looking for money experts, [let me know](mailto:boss@maggiegermano.com).

* I’m holding my first official workshop! On Saturday, September 15th, we’ll be gathering at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/) in Petworth, DC to learn how to budget! Sign up for the [Making & Breaking the Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) workshop today!

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/) is planned and ready for registration! We’ll be focusing on homebuying for first-timers, and we’ll be joined by the wonderful real estate agent (and dear friend) [Liz Delgado-Steo](https://www.realliving.com/elizabeth-delgado-steo). Liz is great at breaking down the homebuying process into language you can understand, so this is a meetup you can’t miss! [Register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-homebuying-for-newbies-tickets-48132651055)!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* We sent our wedding invites out this week! According to The Internet, three months ahead of the wedding is too soon to send out the invitations. But you know what? They were designed, printed, sealed, and stamped early, so I needed them to be out the door. Plus, we've invited quite a few more people than we can actually fit in our venue, so I wanted to give plenty of time to get "no" responses. We also have some people we want to invite later on if there's room, and want to give them plenty of time to respond as well.

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
