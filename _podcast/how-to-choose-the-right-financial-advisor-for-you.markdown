Pam Krueger is the founder and CEO of Wealthramp, an SEC-registered referral service that connects consumers with rigorously vetted and qualified fee-only financial advisors. The company launched the only network of independent, fiduciary, fee-only financial advisors who don’t sell products and work solely in the interests of their clients.

Wealthramp was built on the foundation of consumer advocacy and born out of viewer questions from Pam’s investor-education television series MoneyTrack. She is the creator and co-host of the award-winning program seen nationally on over 250 PBS stations and funded by the Investor Protection Trust. She is the recipient of two Gracie Awards for educating the public about personal investing, and finding the right financial advice, and author of The MoneyTrack Method: A Real Person’s Guide to Successful Investing.

Pam is a respected journalist with her perspectives regularly appearing in MarketWatch, Forbes, NerdWallet, and via her podcast with Terry Savage and Rich Eisenberg, Friends Talk Money, on PBS’s Next Avenue.

A fierce champion for financial education and empowerment, Pam has served on the board of directors of the California Jump$tart Coalition, an organization dedicated to increasing financial literacy among children and teens, and received the Financial Educator of the Year Award from the Financial Literacy Institute. She lives in both Tiburon, California and Cape Cod.
