## **What I’m Up To**

* I was Googling myself the other day to find the podcasts that I've been interviewed on and I found a piece I submitted to Reese Witherspoon's site, [Hello Sunshine](https://hello-sunshine.com/)! I submitted this piece last year and never heard back, so I figured they weren't interested. Turns out, [they published it](https://hello-sunshine.com/post/why-money-is-a-feminist-issue-and-what-im-doing-about-it)!

* I’ve created a virtual [Money Circle membership program](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)! If you are not located in the DC area, or if you just want more connection through Money Circle, this program is for you. There are 3 tiers that offer different options at different price points. There is a group coaching component and even a level that lets you check in with me every month. [Sign up today!](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)

## **What I’m Excited About**

* Last week, Dan and I booked our flights to go to Japan in January! There is a graphic design conference happening in Tokyo in late January, so we're taking advantage and adding a vacation to it. Dan has wanted to go to Japan for basically his whole life and we're both very excited to finally see it. If you've been there and have recommendations, send them my way!

* As I mentioned above, we're going to Peru in 3 weeks! I've been dying to see Peru for a decade, and I'm so excited that it's finally happening. If you have recommendations, send them my way!
