I've previously written about how you should [talk to your romantic partner](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/have-the-money-talk) about money. It's so important to have an open dialogue about finances. Money is connected to a lot of the aspects of life, and often the hang-ups that we have. So in order to be honest with each other, and able to plan for the future, we need to work together.

So now that you've had the money talk,

# Decide how you'll split expenses

# Create a shared spreadsheet

# Make sure the bills are getting paid

# Set up "money dates"
