Money is a tricky subject. It touches every single part of our lives, be it our relationships, our careers, our health, and beyond. This can put stress on us beyond just the literal money concerns. But it also carries with it a societal taboo and a healthy dose of shame, which makes it even harder to deal with. Combine these facts and stress is inevitable.

More than half of all college graduates are women and women make up just under 50 percent of applicants to the top business schools. Yet by the time they graduate and enter the workforce, women are paid a median salary thatâ€™s 81 percent of what their male colleagues make, according to data from the US Department of Labor.

Roughly 75 percent of Americans donâ€™t have any savings to fall back and many live paycheck to paycheck. More than half of all workers admit to feeling financially stressed, costing business an estimated $250 billion a year in lost productivity and absenteeism, according to one Mercer study.

To make things worse, women are more worried about money than men are. According to a study by [Allianz](http://www.allianzusa.com/lovefamilymoney/insights/financial-stress-affects-men-and-women-differently/), 67 percent of women worry about covering their current financial expenses compared to 57 percent of men. It doesn't get much better when it comes to future planning. Eighty-one percent of women stress about planning for their future financial needs compared to 72 percent of men.

Women have less household debt than their male counterparts, but only 42% reported being comfortable with their debt level compared to 56% of men.

The data also revealed that women who live in a modern family structure are less prepared for retirement, saving an average of only $165,200 compared to their male counterparts, who have an average $243,300 saved. And yet, the largest portion of modern family men and women expect to retire at the same age: between the ages of 65 and 69.

So what does all this stress lead to?

As you probably could guess, these problems can lead to more financial trouble! It can become a vicious cycle: financial problems > stress > health and relationship troubles > negative coping behaviors > financial problems > repeat.
