If you've been conscious at all within the last few months (or the last two years), you know that there is a new Supreme Court nominee being vetted by the Senate. Brett Kavanaugh is.... You also probably know that President Trump promised to appoint a Supreme Court Justice who would overturn Roe v. Wade.

What you should also know is that Brett Kavanaugh, in his testimony, referred to birth control as "abortion inducing". If you know anything about birth control or abortion, you know that birth control, including Plan B, does not cause abortion. In fact, it prevents pregnancy, which means it also prevents abortion. However, misinformation abounds, and Brett Kavanaugh is likely willfully ignorant about birth control. The problem with this ignorance, though, is that it puts birth control at risk. We already have Congress fighting the birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act. If we have a majority conservative Supreme Court, it could be fought there as well.
