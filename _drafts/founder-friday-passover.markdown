## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had one Airbnb guest this week

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* 

* I got a massage yesterday. It was way overdue and definitely needed. It's hard to validate spending money on something like this, especially since my income is currently a lot lower than it used to be. However, I built up a nice fun fund last year and this is the exact type of expense it's for. So I pulled that money from my savings and got an amazing massage from Layne at Aura Spa on U Street.

## **What I’m Excited About**

* Dan's family is coming to town today to celebrate Passover with us and see our new house. We were in Syracuse last weekend with my family for Easter, so it's nice to host Passover, even if we're a bit late.

* I was on the Aligned and Alive podcast this week with Alli Owen! We talked about all things money and women and it turned out really well!
