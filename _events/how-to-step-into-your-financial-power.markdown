Do you want to feel more confident about asking for more money? Do you want to feel proud of yourself for being a breadwinner? Join us!\

**About this Event**\

Did you know that 49 percent of employed women in the United States, including 42 percent of working mothers, say they are their familyâ€™s main breadwinner? That's a massive increase from where it used to be.

But did you also know that men are still uncomfortable with their female partners earning more than them?

And the wage gap still persists across the board?

The truth is, women are a force. We are a major part of the economy. We should be earning more money and we should be proud to ask for more.

Come to Money Circle to learn how to ask for more and how to feel more proud and confident about your financial standing.
