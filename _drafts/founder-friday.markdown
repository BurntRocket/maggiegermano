Happy Friday! I'm in Syracuse this weekend spending time with my family for Easter. But here's what I got up to this week.

Before I get started, I want to take a moment to plug myself and ask for your help! I applied for the FedEx Small Business Grant, which awards up to $25,000 to small businesses across the United States. **[Will you vote for me?](https://smallbusinessgrant.fedex.com/home/detail/44f45dd4-966d-4073-8051-115eab79ec3c#/gallery/detail/44f45dd4-966d-4073-8051-115eab79ec3c)** 

If chosen, I would use this grant to subsidize one-on-one financial coaching and group workshops for low-income women who need these services. All women, including those in more difficult financial situations, deserve the same level of support and it is a core value of my business to reach women of all backgrounds and circumstances. This money would enable me to reach women who cannot afford my services and empower them to create a budget, pay down debt, build savings, and become financially stable.

* Two new clients signed up for a one-time session.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I spoke at the [Own It Summit](http://www.ownitsummit.com/) at Georgetown University on Sunday, which was a great experience. Because there's no easy way to get to Georgetown from my house using public transportation, and I don't yet know how to drive Dan's manual car, I had to take a Lyft to and from the campus. It was a bit much to pay for my own speaking gig, so I'll have to come up with a better solution for getting to Georgetown in the future.
