Last September, my fiance, Dan, and I closed on a house near Hyattsville, MD. It's right next to a new Whole Foods, a Gold's Gym, and several other fun spots. It also cost about $100,000 less than a lot of other houses in the area, because it needed quite a bit of work. I thought it was a great investment to buy a livable fixer-upper in a good location, because we'd spend less on fixing it up than we would if we bought a house that had already been flipped. Plus, it had everything I was looking for in a home: a big front porch, a master suite on its own floor, a finished basement with its own separate entrance, a room for my home office, and pretty big backyard. It's also about a mile from the metro, so I can walk there or take the bus easily.

## Redoing the Floors

When we first bought our house, the living room floor was all parkay. When you walked through the living room and into the kitchen, it morphed into a large, tan tile with black grout. That tile continued on into the dining room. I hated everything about those floors. I couldn't imagine living in a house that was almost entirely parkay and tile. I felt that having the floors redone would instantly make the house feel more like our own. 

Plus, we knew we wanted to rent out our basement on Airbnb. The floors in the basement were reminiscent of elementary school floors back in the 80s and 90s. They were ugly and dirty. 

## Fixing Up the Basement

Like I said above, we knew from the beginning that we wanted to rent out our basement. In fact, we were specifically looking for houses with finished basements that had their own entrance. The problem was, the basement had not been very well cared for. Everything was 

## Opening Up the Living Room

When we bought the house, the living room was very narrow. It wasn't really possible to have a couch facing the television if you put it above the mantle. 

## But, There Were Some Regrets...

Now, don't get me wrong, I definitely have some regrets. The contractor that we used for the bulk of the work when we first bought the house definitely overcharged us. By the end of that (very long) process, we felt taken advantage of and foolish. We paid way too much to get new counters installed, and they didn't even check with us before they purchased the counters and new sink. The sink is much smaller than we wanted, but at this point, we don't want to spend more money on this area.
