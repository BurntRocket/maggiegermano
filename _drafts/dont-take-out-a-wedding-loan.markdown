A few weeks ago, I was interviewed by a *Washington Post* reporter about wedding loans. My feedback wasn't included in the [final piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/19/married-debt-couples-are-taking-out-loans-pay-their-weddings/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2e57f929ec82), but the topic and the article got me thinking. If you've been following my blog for a while, you know that I got married last year. I spent over a year planning my wedding and thinking and writing a whole lot about it. I am aware of how expensive weddings can be and how stressful that is. But I also feel very strongly that going into debt for your wedding is not a good idea.

Most of the time, when couples go into debt for their weddings, they're putting it on credit cards or taking out personal loans to cover the costs. More recently, though, companies are marketing what they are calling "wedding loans". These loans are basically the same exact thing as a personal loan: an unsecured loan that you pay off over a period of time. 

Starting your married life with debt can prevent you from reaching other goals, like:

## Going on a Honeymoon

After Dan and I got married, we spent nearly 3 weeks in Thailand on our honeymoon. The cost ended up being just shy of $5,000, including all flights, lodging, activities, food, and shopping. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I'm so grateful that we could experience. 

## Buying a Home

The average wedding in the United States costs upwards of $30,000. That could be a 10% downpayment on a $300,000 house. If you're spending the first couple years of marriage paying off your wedding (which very well may have cost the same amount as your down payment), you may not be able to prioritize saving up for a down payment on a home. 

## Paying Off Other Debt

In the United States, 45 million people are paying back [student loan debt](https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/). The average debt owed is just under $30,000, but many people, especially those who went to grad school, owe much more than that. 

It's not just student loan debt that affects people, though. 

## Having a Happy Marriage

Money trouble is one of the top reasons for marital discord and divorce. It's important to start your marriage on good financial footing.

So what can you do instead?

## Delay Your Wedding

If it's going to take you more than a year or so to save up to pay for your wedding, it might make sense to delay it until you've had time to afford it. This might give you time to pay off debt or save up money or earn more income in order to make your circumstances easier.

## Save The Cash

Save up for your wedding and pay for it in cash. You can do this by automating a certain amount of savings every month or you can put any windfalls (like tax refunds, gifts, or bonuses) into an account designated for your wedding. Or, like Dan and I did, you can do both of those things.

## Change Your Plans

Trust me when I say that I completely understand the desire to throw an awesome party for your wedding. I did that for my own wedding, even though I had major reservations with the cost. Part of me actually wishes that I'd wanted to either elope or have a courthouse wedding so that we could have saved a ton of money for other things. I know people who spent just a couple thousand of dollars on a small wedding and they don't seem to regret it at all.

If you know there's no way you can have an expensive wedding without going into debt, it might be a good idea to explore your other options. You could have a court house ceremony followed by a dinner celebration, you could have a small
