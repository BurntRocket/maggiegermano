## **What I’m Up To**

* Last week, I was quoted in a [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/money-questions-ask-every-week-month-year-2019-7) article about what money questions you should be asking yourself.

* The [July Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-improving-your-credit-score-tickets-63873388023) is up! We’re revisiting the idea of how to improve your credit score. You’ll learn about what impacts your credit score and then what steps you need to take to improve it over time. Register today!

* I’ve been hinting at starting a podcast for a while now. But in order to make sure the podcast is interesting and helpful for YOU, I want to make sure I’m answering your questions. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit any and all money questions that you have!
