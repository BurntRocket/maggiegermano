Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my retainer clients paid their monthly fee.

* One of my ongoing coaching clients paid their monthly fee.

* I got the check for a speaking gig I did last month.

* An Airbnb guest checked out on Tuesday.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* We are having a Halloween party this weekend, so we bought a couple things to make our costumes complete.

* We bought waterproof covers for the chairs and dining set on our deck. We're used to having our furniture out on the covered front porch, and now that they are on the back deck without coverage, we wanted to make sure to protect them from the elements.

* We made the second payment for one of the Airbnbs in Peru.

* We haven't spent this money yet but we're a little anxious that it's going to happen. Over the past two years, I've written a lot about spending lots of money on home improvement. On Tuesday, a crack in a basement wall sprung a leak and was literally pouring water into the laundry room. We had a foundation expert come by yesterday to do a full inspection and it looks like we might need some major foundation work done. I'm trying not to freak out about it yet, since he had to write up a full report for us, and we're going to get a second opinion, but I'm so not thrilled. However, I do think it's important to protect the structural integrity of the house, so we'll do what we have to do.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about [how you can prepare](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-prepare-to-leave-an-abusive-relationship/) to leave an abusive relationship.

## **What I’m Excited About**

We're leaving for Peru in exactly two weeks! I can't wait to get there and explore.

## **What I’m Reading**

I finished reading *[My Sister, The Serial Killer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38819868-my-sister-the-serial-killer?ac=1&from_search=true)* and *[Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068524-not-that-bad?from_search=true)*. Both books left me feeling dejected in different ways. Now I've moved on to *[The Witch Elm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46007673-the-witch-elm)* by Tana French because I can't seem to dig into my nonfiction right now.
