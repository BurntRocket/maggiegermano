I remember while I was growing up, I only really heard about bankruptcy when it came to celebrities like MC Hammer or big businesses like General Motors. I also thought that bankruptcy was something that you could never come back from and was a big admission of defeat and failure. People talked about it like the people who file were stupid and should be ridiculed. But as I've gotten older, as with most things, I've realized that it's more complicated and nuanced than that. Sometimes bankruptcy is the best choice for some people.
