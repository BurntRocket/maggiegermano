## How I Earned Money This Week

* I got a new client starting in February!

## How I Spent Money This Week

* I went out to lunch with two friends on Monday. I spent $9 on tacos at District Taco. Yum.

* Homeownership is something. Somedays it feels like an actual money pit. I love our house but... it's expensive. This week, I spent $275 to get the vermiculite insulation in our attic tested for asbestos. Hurray! Luckily, I still had money set aside for this type of expense, so I didn't have to take a hit financially. **Pot twist:** the substance wasn't even vermiculite and contained no asbestos. So all is well, even though the testing expense was kind of a waste.

* We had quite a bit of groceries left over from last week, so we only spent about $20 on groceries this week. Plus, we made a beef stew that lasted us most of the week!

## What I'm Writing

This week, I wrote about why I decided to quit my very stable day job and become a full-time entrepreneur. [Read it here](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/why-i-quit-my-day-job/)!

## What I'm Excited About

* My grandma is taking our whole family to the Dominican Republic this summer! We're getting close to booking the stay and it's lovely to have warmth and sun to look forward to while it's still frigid outside.

## What I'm Fan-Girling Over

* Kesha's performance of "Praying" at the Grammy's. I'm less keen on [Sony's tweet](https://www.spin.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-kesha-dr-luke-sony-music-tweet/) about the performance, considering they counter-sued her to keep her tethered to her abuser, Dr. Luke.

* I started watching Crazy Ex-Girlfriend earlier this month and I'm still obsessed. The whole series is on Netflix, so dig in! If you've already watched it, try out all four seasons of Grace and Frankie instead.
