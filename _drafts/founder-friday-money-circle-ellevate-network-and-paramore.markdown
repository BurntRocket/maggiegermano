## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* Last week was quiet on the business income front, but this week, the payments for 3 of my monthly clients went through.

* We also had 4 different sets of Airbnb guests this week. We're still going strong!

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I donated $20 to RAICES, which is a Texas organization that is helping detained immigrants get legal representation so that they can be released and (hopefully) reunited with their children. I'm sick and disgusted over the treatment of these people, and I'm ashamed to be an American right now.  

* We bought tickets to go see Paramore at Merriweather Post Pavillion this Saturday! I've loved Paramore since college, and after my sisters saw them perform in Syracuse this past weekend, I decided I needed to splurge on some tickets, as well. Hopefully it doesn't rain too much!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* We had a fantastic [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) gathering this week! The theme was budgeting and we all created our own budgets together. 

* I'll be voting as a Maryland resident for the first time next Tuesday, June 26th! 

* I’m offering [20% off one-time financial coaching sessions](https://maggiegermanofinancialcoaching.as.me/onetimediscount) in the month of June! We’re halfway through 2018, and this is usually the time we realize we haven’t made progress on our goals for the year. If you want some help getting back on track with your finances, let’s talk!

## **What I’m Up To**

* 

* I’m teaming up with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/mo-money-mo-worries-get-financially-savvy-in-2018/washington-dc/49127) on Tuesday, June 26th for a free personal finance workshop in Navy Yard. See you there?

* The [July Money Circle meetup](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/investing-101/) is live! We're bringing in expert Claudia Russell to talk about investing basics. Get your ticket and I'll see you on July 17th!
