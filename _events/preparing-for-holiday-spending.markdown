Whether you celebrate Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Three Kings Day, the Winter Solstice, or none of the above, chances are you'll have to do some holiday spending this winter. For many of us, these events creep up on us and we find ourselves unprepared for all the spending we will do. But the holidays don't always have to be so financially stressful.

It's important to plan for holiday spending months in advance. Join us for Money Circle to learn how you can plan ahead and reduce (or even eliminate) the financial stress that comes up around the holidays.

This event will be held at a home in Eastern Market, 2 blocks from the metro. If you register to attend, you will receive the exact address. FYI: This is a home where cats live. If you are very allergic, this might be the Money Circle to skip!

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks will be provided.

Refunds: Money Circle is a limited seating event. If you have to cancel for any reason within 24 hours, your ticket is non-refundable. However, feel free to gift it or sell it to a friend! Just be sure to let me know of the exchange at hello@maggiegermano.com.
