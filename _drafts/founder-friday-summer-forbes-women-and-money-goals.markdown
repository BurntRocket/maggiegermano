Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* Two of my ongoing coaching clients paid their monthly fee.

* There was a family staying in our Airbnb for the entire week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Monday, I met my friend Nina for tea and catch-up now that she's back from her honeymoon. I paid for metered parking and bought a cup of tea at Takoma Beverage Co. 

* I went downtown for an in-person client session on Tuesday. We were meeting near Union Station, which is easier to drive to than use the metro from my house. I paid for parking.

* I was downtown for 12 hours on Wednesday for the DC Small Business Fair and then Money Circle, so we put Bruno into doggy daycare. It costs $36 a day, so we can't do it super often, but it's a relief to have somewhere to keep him when we're both busy all day. Plus, he was so excited to go there that he ran away from me as soon as we walked in the door. Bonus: he was so exhausted that he basically slept through Thursday.

* This month's Money Circle gathering was about visualizing our goals, so in addition to the usual snacks, I had to buy some arts and crafts materials. Luckily, Walgreens has a shockingly good craft selection.

* This morning, I had breakfast with a friend at Call Your Mother. 

## **What I’m Writing**

* This week on the blog, I wrote about [how to plan ahead](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-plan-ahead-so-you-can-splurge-all-summer/) so that you can splurge all summer.

* I also published a new [Forbes Women](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2019/06/17/despite-having-less-support-women-outpace-men-in-financial-independence/#6a2061369462) piece! I talked about how women are excelling in financial independence, regardless of all the hurdles in our way.

## **What I’m Up To**

* Next Thursday, June 27th, I'll be one of the experts at a prosperity event put on by Lean In DC.

## **What I’m Excited About**

* My best friend, Lexy's, bridal shower is a week from tomorrow! I can't wait to fly up there next Friday to spend the day with her and catch up before her shower. We don't get to see each other enough, so I'm looking forward to celebrating her. Plus, it'll be her birthday!

* My family and I are heading to Bermuda next weekend! My grandma is taking the whole family on a cruise out of NYC down to Bermuda. We're going to dock in Bermuda for 3 days, which I'm so excited about! One of my complaints about cruises is that you don't actually get to see the places that you're traveling to. I plan to spend a lot of time off the ship while we're docked. If you've been to Bermuda and have recommendations, please let me know!

## **What I’m Reading**

I'm whole heartedly reading *[Red, White, and Royal Blue](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41150487-red-white-royal-blue)* by Casey McQuiston. Once I finish it (likely tonight or tomorrow before book club!), I will return to *[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power)* by Naomi Alderman.
