## Get Clear On Your Health Goals

One of the problems with diet culture (and there are *many*) is that we feel pressured to adhere to the goals of other people. And the standards of other people. We put a lot of pressure on ourselves and then don't even end up with what *we* actually want. So I want you to get clear on what actually matters to you, and only you. 

* Do you want to lose weight?

* Do you want to feel stronger?

* Do you want to get your cholesterol down?

* Do you want to lower your blood sugar?

* Do you want to improve your mental health

* Do you want to sleep better?

* Do you want to be less irritable?

\(Hey, those are all my goals!) The point is: figure out what you're actually hoping to achieve. Don't just say "I want to be healthier" because that will be different for everyone. And once you pick your goals, make sure that you make them measurable so that you know when you're meeting them. Plus, you're allowed to revisit and alter your goals if you realize you aren't getting what you thought you wanted.

## Choose a Fitness Routine That You Actually Enjoy

If exercise is part of your health goals, great! But it's important to choose a fitness routine that you actually enjoy. You don't have to suffer through running outside (no thanks) if it makes you miserable and causes you pain. You don't have to go to a dance class that makes you feel foolish and embarrassed (does anyone else know how to actually do zumba?). If you choose something you enjoy, you're much more likely to actually stick to it and have it become a habit. For me, I have a few things I enjoy. I like slow, relaxing yoga. I like body pump classes. I like guided workouts on the stationary bike. I like lifting weights. I'm not going to do all of those things every time I go to the gym, but I'll do at least one of them! And I'm much more likely to follow through with them than I would be if I promised myself I would go for a run or go to power yoga. What's your favorite way to move your body?

## Find An Affordable Way to Work Out

Once you've figured out what kind of exercise you most enjoy, you have to find a way to actually do it. If your favorite exercise is walking, perfect! Walking is free. You just have to find the best routes to take to get the most out of it. But if you've chosen other things that require a gym or a teacher, it can get a little trickier. Luckily, with technology, we have many options to choose from. There are tons of Youtube channels out there with free yoga classes and other forms of exercise. You could even search for what you're looking for on Pinterest and find videos or illustrations that outline specific workout routines. 

There are also lots of apps out there that can provide guided workouts. I use the app associated with my gym to give me guided exercises whenever I'm on the stationary bike, treadmill, or elliptical. There are also guided weightlifting options. That way, I know that I'm working harder. You can also try to find an affordable gym in your area, if you think you'd prefer that. Planet Fitness is notoriously affordable. Washington Sports Club was only $20 a month when I used it. Now, I used Gold's Gym, which is $50 a month, which can be too expensive for some, but that includes the associated app I mentioned. It's all about what you can afford and that you'll use.

Health is not just about your physical body.
