## Find Your Circle

One of the most important things in life is the sense of community - feeling like you’re not alone. This is especially true when it comes to issues that bring us shame and confusion.

We live in a society where money is an unspoken taboo. We aren’t supposed to ask people how much money they earn, and women especially have a hard time knowing and asking for what they are worth. It’s more important than ever to band together and put it all on the table.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.
