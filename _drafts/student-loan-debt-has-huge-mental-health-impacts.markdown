May is Mental Health Awareness Month. It's the one month out of the year when we try to bring awareness to mental health and all of its causes and effects. It's been well known that financial problems can cause mental health problems. In fact, my friend Melanie Lockert, of [Dear Debt](http://deardebt.com/), focuses on this very topic in her work. She learned years ago that many of the people were coming to her website because they were Googling about debt and suicide.

According to a survey done by [Student Loan Planner](https://www.studentloanplanner.com/mental-health-awareness-survey/), 20 percent of high student loan borrowers have considered suicide.

The moral of this article is that it's normal and common to feel bad about your financial situation, especially when a lot of debt is involved. But it's important to remember that your debt, or your past mistakes, don't define you. You have inherent worth outside of this. Reach out and get help when you need it.
