When we talk about moving in with someone, we talk a lot about splitting chores and choosing decor. And those things are important to make sure that you and your partner feel supported and comfortable at home. However, there's more to the story in planning a life together.

One thing that doesn't always come up right away is how to deal with money once you're joining your life with someone else. Every couple is different, so there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to merging finances. The most important thing to do is to figure out what works best for you and your partner.

This month, at Money Circle, we'll be talking about the different approaches for merging finances, how to have that money conversation, and how to make sure that everyone feels good about it.

If you know that merging finances is going to be on your radar soon, this meetup is for you!

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks will be provided.
