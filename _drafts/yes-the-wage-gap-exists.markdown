A few weeks ago, I spoke at a college leadership event in Virginia. I led a workshop that helped college students understand how to start their careers on the right financial foot. Overall, the presentation went very well. A lot of students in the audience clearly got a lot out of the content and many of them came up to me afterwards to ask more questions. However, there was one student, a young man, who seemed to find my presentation very amusing. He laughed to himself quietly throughout the entire thing. I mostly ignored him and continued to teach the room. At the end, though, he was one of those who came up to me.

> Then he asked me if I know that the wage gap doesn't actually exist.

I was a little curious that he'd be approaching me, since he didn't seem to pay much attention to the presentation itself. At first, he asked me about the part of my work that is related to closing the wage gap. He asked if I am an activist for it or if I just teach salary negotiation tactics. I told him that I do both. Then he asked me if I know that the wage gap doesn't actually exist. We went back and forth for a little bit, me insisting that it does exist, him insisting that it doesn't. He told me to look on the internet and I would see that it is a myth. I told him that the government has statistics around it. He walked away still not believing me, I walked away feeling frustrated and annoying.

However, I realized that I know that the wage gap exists, and I know the numbers for the wage gap for different groups of women. But it occurred to me that I can't easily point to the research that proves this phenomenon. So, I've decided to do my own research and write about it! Here are the real facts about the wage gap.

## The Wage Gap Exists in Nearly Every Occupation

## The Wage Gap Begins Before Women Have Children

I've heard more than one person (usually men), including at least one friend, who argue that the wage gap only exists because women leave the workforce in order to care for their children. Usually, these people also talk about this as if it is entirely by choice and not by necessity because of how unfriendly our society is towards families. The need for some women to leave the workforce in order to care for children or other family members is also a problem, but I'll get to that in a later post. 

But the truth is, wage gap statistics actually account for the moments when women leave the workforce in order to assume the caretaker role.

## The Wage Gap is Worse for Women of Color

When we talk about the wage gap generally, the number is weighted because 

Women of all major racial and ethnic groups earn less than men of the same group as well as white men.

So there you have it. The wage gap is real. And the data exists to prove it. You can find anything you want to believe by searching on the internet, but the key is to make sure there is reputable research to back it up.
