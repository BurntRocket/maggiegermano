*Since August is a huge travel month, the blog theme is financially responsible travel! Tune in for plenty of tips on how to travel on a budget.*

Is travel a value of yours? Do you cherish experiences over things? I know how you feel! I love to travel and see new places, and I make it a priority in my life. However, I often hear from other people that they wish they could travel, but they just can't afford it. Of course, not everyone can afford to travel abroad on an annual basis, but that doesn't mean that you will never be able to see the cities you dream of. If you plan ahead, you can afford to get on the road. Here are some of my ways for how to do that!

## Plan out your trips ahead of time

It's a dream of mine to be able to take advantage of an amazing travel deal and book a trip at the last minute. It sounds so luxurious to be free to travel whenever you want. But that's not actually a realistic dream for most of us. (At least not yet!) So, in order to

Look at your calendar. What does the next year look like for you? Write down all of the obligations that you might have, especially those that include travel. It could be holidays, a friend's wedding, your mom's 60th birthday party, etc.

## Determine how much money you'll need

Once you have written down all of the travel that you plan to do, start researching how much it might cost. These costs would include flights (or other modes of transportation), lodging (hotels, Airbnb, hostels), food, activities, and shopping. Overestimate how much you think you'll spend, because you're probably more likely to spend more than less. 

If this number seems unachievable, break it down. How much would you have to save each month to make it happen? Does it seem more realistic when you look at it that way? If it looks like you won't be able to save enough money to afford all the traveling you want to do, you might have to reassess your plans. Perhaps that trip to Europe can wait until next year. And look at it this way: with more time to plan and save up for a trip, the experience will be even better!

## Set money aside each month

Put aside money every month in a travel savings account.  I recommend automating the savings, so that you don't spend the money before you can set it aside. Not sure how much to save? Take the number you came up with above and divide it by 12. That's how much you should automate to go into your travel savings account each month. 

## Save your windfalls

Did you get an end-of-year bonus at work? Are you expecting a hefty [tax refund](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/heres-how-you-should-use-your-tax-refund/)? If you don't have important bills to pay off with that money, set it aside for travel savings!
