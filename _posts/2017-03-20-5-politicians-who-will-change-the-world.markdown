The results of the 2016 presidential election were (and still are) pretty hard to stomach. I desperately wanted to see Hillary Clinton as our first woman president, but I also don't think she was our first and only hope. This Women's History Month, let's celebrate a few other politicians who will change the world. 

## Elizabeth Warren

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been in the news recently, thanks to Mitch McConnell. I'm sure you've heard by now that she was warned, she was given an explanation. Nevertheless, [she persisted](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-nevertheless-she-persisted-trnd/). But before Senator Warren gained infamy during Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing, she made a name for herself in other ways.
