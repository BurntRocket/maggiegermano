Your host, Maggie Germano, is passionate about helping women improve their relationships with money so that they can take better control of their futures. Part of that journey is making personal finance education more accessible and less judgmental, which is why the Money Circle podcast exists. Each week, Maggie will discuss a new financial topic to help you explore how you can make a difference in your own financial life or in society as a whole.
