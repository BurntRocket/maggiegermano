*Pre-S: This month's blog theme is money and how it relates to our loved ones.*

Who even are the Joneses? Why do we care about them? "Keeping up with the Joneses" is an old idiom that refers to comparing yourself to those around you in order to determine your social status. Funny enough, this phrase originated from a [comic strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_Up_with_the_Joneses_(comics)) of the same name, which ran from 1913 to 1940.

Now how does this idiom impact us? It puts unseen pressure on us to be as good, as successful, as wealthy, as impressive as those around us seem to be. This pressure leads us to do things we don't truly want to do and spend more money than we have or want to spend.

## 1. Clarify your own values

It's important that your money habits line up with your personal values.

## 2. Get better friends

If you feel pressured by your friends, neighbors, or loved ones to live outside of your means, maybe it's time for them to go. It's important to remember that not everyone is meant to stay in our lives. Just because you were friends with someone in middle school doesn't mean you need to be friends with them now.
