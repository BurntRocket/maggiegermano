## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about why you should care about your [financial profile](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/your-financial-profile-like-your-tinder-profile/) (aka, your credit score, credit history, credit report, etc.). 

## **What I’m Up To**

* On Wednesday, March 6th, I will be at the [Lemon Collective](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aligning-your-money-with-your-values-tickets-54778910195) leading a workshop on how to align your money with your values.

* On Tuesday, March 12th, I will be at [Mindspace](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-tickets-55047193638) leading a workshop called Making & Breaking the Budget. If you struggle with creating and sticking to a budget, this one is for you!

* On Wednesday, March 27th, I’ll be hosting Money Circle. We’ll be joined by personal style coach, [Allison Hamilton-Rohe](https://dailyoutfit.com/), since our topic is: [How To Create a Powerful Personal Style On A Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-create-a-powerful-personal-style-on-a-budget-tickets-54939672038).

## **What I’m Excited About**

* Dan and I are finally getting a puppy this weekend! We drove down to Richmond last weekend to meet a corgi puppy and we loved him on sight. We are driving back down first thing tomorrow to pick him up and take him home with us. Follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maggiegermano/) to see how cute he is!
