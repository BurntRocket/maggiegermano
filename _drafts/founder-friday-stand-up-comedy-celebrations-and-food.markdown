Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here's what I was up to!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* One of my monthly clients' payment went through this week.

* The [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) payments were transferred from Eventbrite after the event on Tuesday.

* We had two different Airbnb guests throughout the week.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* On Sunday, Dan and I got bagels at [The Bagel Place](https://www.bagelplacecollegepark.com/) for breakfast. We rarely go out for food on the weekends, but we wanted to treat ourselves. It was totally worth it.

* On Monday, I got some pretty exciting news about my business (I'll announce soon!), so Dan and I went to [Burton's Grill & Bar](https://burtonsgrill.com/) in Riverdale Park to celebrate. We hadn't been to that restaurant yet, so it was nice to finally try it out. It's a little overpriced for the Maryland suburbs, but the food was good. Dan got the maxx burger with bacon and I got the lobster shrimp pasta.

* I don't go into DC everyday, but when I do, the Metro fare is more expensive than it was when I lived in the city. So I go through my Metro money pretty quickly. I had to reload my card this week since I went downtown three times!

* My mom's birthday was this past Wednesday and my dad's birthday is next Saturday, so I bought two cute cards at [Cherry Blossom Creative](http://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/) this week. Yes, I'm behind on buying actual gifts, but this was progress!

* I just recently rolled of the [Collective Action for Safe Spaces](http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/) board of directors, but I still support what they do and love the people. So this week, I went to a fundraising happy hour at [Little Coco's](http://www.littlecocos.com/) and bought two beers. If you want to [donate](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/collectiveactiondc) to CASS and support their work, I highly recommend it! If you can't afford to donate, volunteer with them!

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about personal loans and whether or not they are right for you. If you struggle with credit card debt and are looking for a solution, personal loans might be a good option. [Read the article](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/whats-a-personal-loan-and-when-should-you-get-one/) and be honest with yourself about whether or not a personal loan might get you into a better financial position.

## What I’m Up To

## What I'm Excited About

* We had a sold out [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) gathering this week! It was the first time we've sold out, which was super exciting! Y'all are really interested in learning all you can about investing, and [Claudia Russell](http://msengineeredwealth.com/) did a great job as our expert! (See you next month at our [homebuying](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/) Money Circle?)

* I mentioned [last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/founder-friday-beer-curtains-and-biz-development/) that I joined the [Signed](https://www.smartgetspaid.com/signed/) business and sales program with Leah Neaderthal. We had our first module and video call this week, and it was incredibly illuminating. 

* I'm obsessed with stand-up comedy lately. I listen to the podcast [Put Your Hands Together](https://www.earwolf.com/show/put-your-hands-together/) on a weekly basis. I loved Cameron Esposito's new special called *[Rape Jokes](https://www.cameronesposito.com/)*, I laughed and sobbed through Hannah Gadsby's *[Nanette](https://www.netflix.com/title/80233611)*, I watch anything that [Tig Notaro](http://tignation.com/) does... you get the idea. So imagine my excitement when I saw that Cameron Esposito and her wife, Rhea Butcher, are coming to DC with Tig Notaro for the [Bentzen Ball](https://brightestyoungthings.com/bentzen-ball) in October! I bought my tickets first thing this morning and can't wait to attend. See you there?

* I'm heading home to Syracuse next weekend for my bridal shower! I was torn about whether or not I wanted a bridal shower, but now I'm really excited to be with my family to celebrate my upcoming marriage. I can't wait to see what my sisters came up with for the party!
