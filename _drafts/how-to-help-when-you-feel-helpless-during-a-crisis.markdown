When a crisis is occurring and we are far away from it, we can feel either helpless or disinterested. When something doesn't impact us, it's easy to turn a blind eye. But as our world becomes more and more connected, it's more and more important to do what we can to help our fellow humans.

Over this past weekend, Hurricane Harvey, a category X hurricane, made landfall

## Donate

## Spread the word

Maybe you don't have much money to spare. That's okay!

## Open your home

I read yesterday that [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com/disaster/hurricaneharveyevacuees) has created a platform where hosts can rent their space for free, and people from Houston can sign up for a place to stay. This is such a fantastic idea, as many people are unable to leave their homes due to financial limitations. If you rent out space on AirBnb, and you aren't far from Houston, I highly recommend that you offer up that space to people fleeing the hurricane.

\(AirBnb is also waiving all service fees for those affected by the hurricane and checking in between August 23rd and September 1st.)
