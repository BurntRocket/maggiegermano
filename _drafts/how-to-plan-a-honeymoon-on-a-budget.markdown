I'm on my honeymoon right now! Well, I'm actually in the air or in an airport somewhere. We left DC late last night and are en route to Thailand for a three-week honeymoon adventure! You can keep track of what we're up to by following my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maggiegermano/).

## Save, Save, Save

## Take Advantage of Rewards Programs

## Keep Track of Deals

## Delay

More and more of my friends are delaying their honeymoon for six months or a year. That's a great way to recoup some of the money you spent on your wedding and give you time to save up for your honeymoon.
