It goes a little something like this: your best friend goes on an amazing trip to Europe, you graciously "like" all of her Instagram photos, but you're seething with jealousy. Or your cousin had all of her education paid for by her parents, and you think she's a spoiled brat for it. Jealousy comes up a lot, especially when we take money into consideration. It's totally natural, but it can also make you start resenting your loved ones. So not only will you be jealous, but then you'll be pissed off at your favorite people for their circumstances, and then you'll probably feel bad for feeling that way. It's not a great cycle to find yourself in, and there are ways to work through it.

## Practice Gratitude

When you're constantly comparing your own life against others', you can forget how fortunate you already are.

## Get Off Social Media

I love social media as much as the next person, but it absolutely has a way of making me feel inadequate. Don't forget: most of us are only showing our highlight reels. We aren't showing the days that aren't going so well. 

## Have a Conversation

You never know what is actually going on in someone's life unless you ask them. Your friend who doesn't have any student loan debt is fortunate, but she might have medical debt you don't know about. Your friend who had a lavish European vacation may have saved up for that trip for years before she could finally go.

## Analyze Your Own Life

What is it about your friends' lives that you're jealous of?
