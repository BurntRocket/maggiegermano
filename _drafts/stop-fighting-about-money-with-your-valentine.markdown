Just in time for Valentine's Day, there's been [a study](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123005479/en/Stop-Arguing-Financial-Tips-Couples) released by Elevate’s [Center for the New Middle Class](https://newmiddleclass.org/blog/) about love and money. As you may have heard, financial problems are one of the leading causes of relationship strife. But it doesn't have to be that way! I'm a [huge proponent](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/have-the-money-talk) for talking openly about money with your partner (and everyone else in your life!) Money touches every part of our lives, so it's important to get on the same page with the person you're sharing your life with. 

Do you, like 21 percent of the marriages in this study, exhibit behaviors of unhealthy financial partnership? This can look like:

* Failing to reach financial compromises

* Not comfortable talking with each other about finances

* Feeling that their partner does not support their financial goals

* Not understanding each other’s position in arguments

But it doesn't have to be this way! Even if this is how your relationship has felt so far, there are changes that you can make to improve things.
