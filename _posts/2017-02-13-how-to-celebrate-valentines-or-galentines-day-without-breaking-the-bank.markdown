Tomorrow's the day! I'm sure you've been inundated since January with Valentine's Day sales and gimmicks. Many of us don't like the pressure that Valentine's Day brings; it's a Hallmark holiday that forces us to spend money in order to prove that we love someone.

I've always enjoyed these types of holidays, though. In school, I would wear all red or pink, with a heart sticker somewhere on my body. I loved giving out Valentine's Day cards to my friends and family. As I got older, I liked spending the evening with my girlfriends, eating chocolate and watching bad movies. Now that I have a partner, the day is a little different, but it doesn't have to be stressful. So, whether you you'll spend the day with a friend, lover, or family member, you don't have to go broke.

## 1. Cook dinner at home



## 2. Go to a low-cost event

## 3. Go outside

If it's not too cold out, spend time in nature! Go for a walk or a hike.
