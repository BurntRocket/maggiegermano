Almost two weeks ago now, I attended my fourth [FinCon](https://finconexpo.com/). It's an annual conference where financial professionals and brands come together to learn from each other and make relationships. I first attended when I was merely six months into being a financial coach, and this year is the first time that I felt like I actually knew a lot of people and could help educate others. In fact, I was on a panel about remaining authentic while building a financial coaching business. Needless to say, it was a whirlwind four days and I was pretty exhausted (in a good way) afterwards. One of my biggest takeaways, though, was a keynote speech that I didn't think I would actually enjoy. 

[Ramit Sethi](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/) was one of the opening keynote speakers for FinCon on Thursday, September 5th. I've never followed Ramit's work very closely, after being turned off by his abrasive approach to financial advice years ago. I actually considered skipping his talk in favor of chatting with friends or grabbing breakfast. But I'm glad that I stayed, because Ramit gave a great talk that had fantastic takeaways for all of us in the audience.
