## Stop Using Your Credit Cards

After paying off credit card debt, it can be easy to start racking up that debt again. This is a dangerous cycle to get trapped in. If you've struggled with overspending and credit card debt in the past, do yourself a favor and stop using your credit cards. Set up a budget based on your income and expenses and use cash or debit only. This will protect you from going back into debt after working so hard to get out of it.

## Keep Your Accounts Open 

Just because you've paid off your debt and stopped using credit cards doesn't mean you have to close your accounts. The length of your credit history and the credit available to you is really helpful to your credit score. And your credit score is important when it comes to future financial decisions like buying a car or a home. So even if you're going to stop using your credit cards, keep the accounts themselves open so that they can help improve your credit score. If you don't want the temptation of the cards, cut them up or give them to a trusted friend to lock away. They can be open even if they aren't available to you!

## Allocate That Money Towards Your Goals

You've paid off your debt, congratulations! You now have much more money available to you to use for anything you want. But be careful not to just start spending all of that money every month. In fact, you've lived without it while paying off your debt, so what can you put it towards now that will help you? The best opportunity here is to start putting it into savings. This can be an emergency savings account or retirement savings. This is especially important if you haven't been able to save for these things up until now. Automate this savings so that you aren't tempted to spend the money now that it's in your account!
