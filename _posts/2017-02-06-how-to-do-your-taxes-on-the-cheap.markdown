Like I said [last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/heres-how-you-should-use-your-tax-refund/), tax season is upon us! You have until Tuesday, April 18th to file your taxes. If you're living or working outside of the US, you have until Thursday, June 15th to file. I recommend getting an early start so you can avoid the stress of rushing against a deadline. However, if you think you'll need to [file for an extension](https://20somethingfinance.com/irs-tax-extension/), you need to postmark the extension request by April 18th.

Now that you're ready to file your taxes (early!), you shouldn't spend a bunch of money doing so. Here are some ways to do your taxes for free (or cheaply).

## 1. [Turbo Tax](turbotax.com)

This is the program that I usually use. The user experience is pretty good (except for them trying to upsell you the whole time), and the process isn't confusing. You can file your federal taxes for free, but usually have to pay around $20 for the state filing. I also found out this year that it costs $89 to file business taxes using Turbo Tax, which makes me sad.

## 3. [Credit Karma Tax](https://www.creditkarma.com/tax)

Credit Karma is known for providing your credit score for free. And if you're not already using it for that, you should! (Credit Sesame is another option.) This year, Credit Karma unveiled its brand new tax filing program. Credit Karma Tax has free federal and state e-filing. According to them, there is no paid option - it is all free, and there's no annoying upselling! 

## 4. [The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-you-by-volunteers)

This program is offered through the IRS. You qualify if you earn under $54,000, are disabled, or aren't a fluent English speaker. IRS-certified volunteers provide free basic income tax return preparation with electronic filing to qualified individuals.

## 5. [Free File Alliance](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)

This software is available to taxpayers who earn under $64,000

## 6. [My Free Taxes](http://www.unitedway.org/myfreetaxes/)

Do you make under $64,000 a year? United Way has partnered with H&R Block to offer My Free Taxes.
