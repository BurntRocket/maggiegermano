Happy Friday! I've been thoroughly enjoying the springlike weather in DC this week. It makes me so happy to have lots of sunshine and not be sweating profusely whenever I walk outside. Anyway, here's what I was up to this week!

## How I Earned Money This Week

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I are making a concerted effort to eat well for the month of June. I also got a warning from my doctor about my cholesterol, so it's about more than just feeling and looking good now. We're trying out the [Flat Belly Diet](https://www.amazon.com/Flat-Belly-Diet-Liz-Vaccariello/dp/1250013356), which focuses on filling your diet with good fats that are good for your heart and help combat belly fat. We spent a ton of money at Costco on Sunday getting all of the bulk items we need for the month. We also spent a good amount on other items at Safeway. The good thing is, we won't be spending any money going out to eat, so the costs should even out really well.

* We found really cute thank you cards on Amazon that we'll send out after our wedding. I was a little stressed out about the prospect of spending hundreds of dollars on another paper item for the wedding, so I was relieved to find cards on Amazon that Dan and I both liked. Bonus: They were only $20 for 100! I also bought a different set of thank you cards specifically to send out after my bridal shower. As luck would have it, they almost perfectly match the invitations my little sister picked out.

* My friend Rachel recently turned me onto Poshmark when I complained that the outfit I wanted to wear for my rehearsal dinner was sold out. I've definitely been going down a rabbit hole looking at discounted shoes and other items. The Rothy's shoes I really wanted to wear to my wedding are no longer being made, and I haven't been able to find them anywhere. So I kept poking around Poshmark to see if there's anything else that catches my eye. I found a really cute pair of teal flats and haggled them for only $15! If I love them as much as I think I will, they'll be my wedding shoes. We did the same thing for Dan and found a pair of dress shoes that are exactly what he was looking for. But instead of paying over $200 for them, we paid only $25! Hell yes for Poshmark! (If you want $5 off your first Poshmark order, use the code **"MAGGERMANO"** when you sign up!)

## What I’m Writing

For the month of June, I'm writing blog posts about questions I've been asked by clients and [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) members. This week, I wrote about what your options are for [student loan debt consolidation](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-are-my-options-for-student-loan-consolidation/). I hope it helps!

## What I’m Excited About

## What I’m Up To

* The [June Money Circle meetup](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-make-a-budget/) is on June 20th! We’ll be gathering to talk about budgeting basics and we'll create our own budgets. I’ll be there to guide you and answer your questions. Join us!

* I’m teaming up with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/mo-money-mo-worries-get-financially-savvy-in-2018/washington-dc/49127) on Tuesday, June 26th for a free personal finance workshop in Navy Yard. See you there?
