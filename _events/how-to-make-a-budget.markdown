We live in a society where money is an unspoken taboo. We aren’t supposed to ask people how much money they earn, and women especially have a hard time knowing and asking for what they are worth. It’s more important than ever to band together and put it all on the table.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.

**Refunds:** Money Circle is a limited seating event. If you have to cancel for any reason within 24 hours, your ticket is non-refundable. However, feel free to gift it or sell it to a friend! Just be sure to let me know of the exchange at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com).
