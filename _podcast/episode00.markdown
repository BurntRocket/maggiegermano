**Transcription:**

Maggie Germano: "Hey there. Welcome to the Money Circle podcast. My name is Maggie Germano and I'm a feminist and financial coach for women. I help women develop healthy relationships with money and take control of their finances. I do this through one on one coaching, speaking, workshops, writing, in-person meetups, and now this podcast. Money Circle is a safe, open space where women can talk about money without judgment. It is a place for women to ask questions, share fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about their money struggles. I founded Money Circle three and a half years ago to create community and break the taboo around money. I wanted to hold space for women to feel less alone in their financial problems. It started as a Facebook group, grew into a monthly in-person meetup in Washington, DC, expanded to include a virtual membership, and now it's also a podcast.

As for this podcast, I'll be here every week to answer your questions about money, give advice, and interview other amazing women about their expertise and how it relates to money. I aim to make money less scary, less confusing, and more accessible. I want to help you feel more confident and more excited about your financial future.

If you have a specific question or issue that you need my help with, email me at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com). If you know a woman who would make a wonderful guest on this show, send me her name too.
