Freaking out about tax season? I'm sure you're not alone! Taxes can feel confusing and overwhelming. Plus, many of us never really learned much about them. That's why I want to create a space where you can ask questions and talk about how taxes fit into the bigger picture of our lives.

We'll be joined by [Cady North](https://www.northfinancialadvisors.com/), the founder and CEO of North Financial Advisors. She will talk about how taxes fit into your overarching financial goals, and answer your questions. 

See you there?
