October is National Women's Small Business Month! [As of 2015](https://www.nawbo.org/resources/women-business-owner-statistics), 9.1 million business in the United States were owned by women, 2.9 million of which are owned by women of color. These businesses generate $1.4 trillion dollars in sales. This has been a huge increase from years past. So basically, women are kicking ass in business!
