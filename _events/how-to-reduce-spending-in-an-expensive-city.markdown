This month, we will discuss how to reduce spending in an expensive city like DC. It’s easy to just accept the fact that DC is a costly city that requires you to break the bank in order to have a life. But it doesn’t have to be that way! There are still ways to reduce your spending in an expensive city. Now that spring has sprung and we are less likely to hibernate inside with Netflix, what better time to share ways to cut costs?

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they have around money.

There will be snacks, mimosas, and tea for all. This event is very casual, and all you have to bring is yourself and openness.
