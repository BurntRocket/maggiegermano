Happy Friday! I'm in Syracuse this weekend spending time with my family for Easter.

Before I get started, I want to take a moment to plug myself and ask for your help! I applied for the FedEx Small Business Grant, which awards up to $25,000 to small businesses across the United States. **[Will you vote for me?](https://smallbusinessgrant.fedex.com/home/detail/44f45dd4-966d-4073-8051-115eab79ec3c#/gallery/detail/44f45dd4-966d-4073-8051-115eab79ec3c)**

If chosen, I would use this grant to subsidize one-on-one financial coaching and group workshops for low-income women who need these services. All women, including those in more difficult financial situations, deserve the same level of support and it is a core value of my business to reach women of all backgrounds and circumstances. This money would enable me to reach women who cannot afford my services and empower them to create a budget, pay down debt, build savings, and become financially stable.

You can **[vote](https://smallbusinessgrant.fedex.com/home/detail/44f45dd4-966d-4073-8051-115eab79ec3c#/gallery/detail/44f45dd4-966d-4073-8051-115eab79ec3c)** once every 24 hours until April 4th! Thank you!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* Two new clients signed up for a one-time session this week.

* One of my monthly clients' payment went through on Wednesday.

* [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) was on Monday and the fees from that are coming through from Eventbrite.

* We had one Airbnb guest stay in our basement for the whole week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I spoke at the [Own It Summit](http://www.ownitsummit.com/) at Georgetown University on Sunday, which was a great experience. Because there's no easy way to get to Georgetown from my house using public transportation, and I don't yet know how to drive Dan's manual car, I had to take a Lyft to and from the campus. It was a bit much to pay for my own speaking gig, so I'll have to come up with a better solution for getting to Georgetown in the future.

* Since I was in DC for [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/), I stopped by Trader Joe's and stocked up on my favorite items (Dark Chocolate Covered Powerberries, Raw Milk Shredded Parmesan Cheese, Roasted and Salted Sunflower Seeds).

* The payment for last Friday's [Hungry Harvest](http://hharvest.net/m5didTk) order went through.

* My monthly donation to [Collective Action for Safe Spaces](http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/) went through. Are you a monthly sustaining donor yet? [Start now!](http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/get-involved/monthly-giving-society/)

* I ordered two books and [Coco](https://www.amazon.com/Coco-2018-Animation-Family-Adventure/dp/B079ZXN8ZS/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1522344570&sr=8-2-spons&keywords=coco\+dvd&psc=1) on DVD for my niece and nephew. If you haven't watched that movie yet, you must!

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, for the [final post](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/financial-security-is-feminist/) of Women's History Month, I wrote about how and why I feel that financial security is a feminist act.

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I was featured on the [Idealist](https://idealistcareers.org/financial-coach-women/) blog, talking about how I made my transition from the nonprofit world to entrepreneurship.

* I’m leading a personal finance workshop at [Varnish Lane](https://varnishlane.com/) nail salon for their first Varnish Lane After Hours event! Join us next **[Thursday, April 5th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/varnish-lane-after-hours-personal-finances-tickets-44203571071)**!

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

* When was the last time you checked your credit report? You can check it for free once a year from each of the three credit bureaus! Go to [annualcreditreport.com](http://www.annualcreditreport.com) to get your credit report, where you can see your full credit history. This is a great way to see what might be impacting your credit score, and dispute any errors that are listed. 

That’s all from me for this week! Enjoy your weekend!
