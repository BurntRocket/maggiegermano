What's more interesting than health benefits?! Open enrollment season is coming up, and I'm sure you have a lot of questions. Do you feel confused every year, not entirely sure what you're actually signing up for? Worried that you might be short changing yourself? Join us this month to talk everything health insurance, dental insurance, HSAs, and more!

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they have around money. I will provide light snacks and wine.
