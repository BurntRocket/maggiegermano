April is Autism Acceptance Month. In honor of that, I interviewed [Femme Frugality's](https://femmefrugality.com/) Brynne Conroy on the [Money Circle podcast](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/government-resources-for-families-with-special-needs-kids/) all about the financial resources that are available for families with kids who have special needs. Brynne is a fantastic resource for this and updates her materials every year to make sure that all of the information is accurate. If you, or someone you know, have a child with autism or a child with other special needs, these resources will be incredibly helpful.

As Brynne mentioned in the podcast episode, some states allow children with special needs to be on Medicaid, regardless of their parents' income.
