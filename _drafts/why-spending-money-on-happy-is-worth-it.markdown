If you've been reading my blog for a while, you know that I'm not one of those financial bloggers who tells you to give up everything you love in order to pay off debt and build up savings. Yes, it takes some sacrifice to get yourself to a better financial situation. That's true when you want to make any kind of change or improvement. But I also believe that it's incredibly important to allow yourself joy and comfort.

For instance, have you ever decided you wanted to get fit and/or lose weight? You've probably tried a handful of different diets or exercise routines. You tell yourself you're not going to eat ANY sugar and you're going to work out every single day. How long does that usually last for you? In my experience, it doesn't last very long.
