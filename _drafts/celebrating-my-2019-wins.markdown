A few years ago, I started writing out all of my accomplishments from the past year, rather than only focusing on resolutions for the new year. This was a helpful way to remind myself of everything I actually did achieve that year, instead of only thinking about how I could improve myself moving forward. I am always pleasantly surprised at how much I did in just one year. This exercise also helps me set goals for the next year in an informed and confident way. Here's what I came up with for this year:

## Personal Wins

Getting married and having babies is not the most important thing to ever happen to women. In fact, a friend of mine created a [greeting card company](https://stefanieoconnell.com/statement-cards) that says just that! But there are plenty of personal achievements that I am very proud of from this past year. 

* I started going back to therapy regularly.

* I officiated one of my best friend's wedding.

* Dan and I went to see Hamilton on Broadway.

* We got a corgi puppy, Bruno.

* Dan and I went to Chicago, Bermuda, Maine, and Peru.

* I went to Cape May with my sisters and two of my cousins for a girls trip.

* Dan and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary.

* I finally got comfortable driving a car (it only took 15 years).

* I joined a book club and I attend every month, even if I haven't read the book yet (which is most months).

* I worked with a health coach to start taking control over my health.

* I worked with a style coach to feel more confident about my wardrobe and body.

## Professional Wins

As an entrepreneur, I don't get to go through an official year-end review with my boss. So I don't get any organized feedback about what I did well or what I need to improve upon. This can make it easy to ignore the things I have done well, because I'm mostly working by myself. So going back and reviewing what I achieved with my business can be a great confidence boost, as well as an opportunity for learning and improving.

* I landed my highest paying speaking gig.

* I traveled to Atlanta and Boston for speaking gigs.

* I spoke on a panel at [FinCon](https://finconexpo.com/).

* I launched my podcast, [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/).

* I won the Excellence in Finance award at the Perfect Entrepreneur Awards.

* I earned 40% more in my business this year than I did last year.

* I attended [Statement](https://www.statementevent.co/) for the first time.

* I attended [ShePodcasts Live](https://www.shepodcasts.live/).

## Financial Wins

* Dan and I both got life  insurance.

* We found out about and qualified for a home improvement grant from our town, which helped reduce those costs by $1,000 per qualifying project.

* We bought a new car in cash.

* We earned nearly $12,000 (before taxes and expenses) from our basement Airbnb.

* Dan got a new job after he got laid off at his company, with a healthy salary increase.
