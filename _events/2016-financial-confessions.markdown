In the spirit of the new year, I want us to gather to review the past year and plan for the upcoming one. And rather than just making resolutions that we'll break in two months, let's set real goals.

What are you most proud of from 2016? What do you wish youâ€™d done better, financially? What are your goals for 2017? Do you need any support from me or other Money Circle women to reach them? Join us at Money Circle this month to share your financial confessions and goals without judgment!

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they have around money. I will provide light snacks and wine.
