What could a Trump Presidency mean for your financial future? This month, we will discuss how to prepare for uncertainty around healthcare, job security, equal rights, etc. Join us at Money Circle this month to show solidarity and make plans to protect ourselves and our money moving forward.

Wine and light snacks will be provided.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they have around money.
