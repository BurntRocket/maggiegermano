If you're within a certain age range, you probably feel like everyone in the world is getting married at the same time. I hear you! A few years ago, I went to EIGHT weddings in one year. It was insane. And it's not just the wedding itself. Theres bridal showers, bachelor/bachelorette parties, travel, gifts, etc. Weddings can add up FAST, and not just for the couple tying the knot. 

You're not alone in feeling completely overwhelmed and broke while your friends are getting married. So come to Money Circle to vent, share tips and tricks for how you saved money, and support each other during these busy and expensive parts of life.

One of the most important things in life is the sense of community - feeling like you’re not alone. This is especially true when it comes to issues that bring us shame and confusion.

We live in a society where money is an unspoken taboo. We aren’t supposed to ask people how much money they earn, and women especially have a hard time knowing and asking for what they are worth. It’s more important than ever to band together and put it all on the table.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.

**Refunds:** Money Circle is a limited seating event. If you have to cancel for any reason within 24 hours, your ticket is non-refundable. However, feel free to gift it or sell it to a friend! Just be sure to let me know of the exchange at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com).
