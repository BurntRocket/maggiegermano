Like I said [last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/heres-how-you-should-use-your-tax-refund/), tax season is upon us! You have until Tuesday, April 18th to file your taxes. If you're living or working outside of the US, you have until Thursday, June 15th to file. I recommend getting an early start so you can avoid the stress of rushing against a deadline. However, if you think you'll need to [file for an extension](https://20somethingfinance.com/irs-tax-extension/), you need to postmark the extension request by April 18th.
