Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Sunday, Dan and I drove to Richmond to meet our future puppy, and we bought some snacks at the gas station on the way home. We also put down a deposit on the puppy.

* Since we knew we would be bringing home a puppy this weekend, we had a lot of supplies to buy! We used Chewy to buy an exercise pen, potty pads, food, toys, shampoo, food bowls, a collar, leash, bed, and more. Luckily, we saved up for these expenses way ahead of time, so it's not hurting our wallet!

* There are a few things around the house that we need to do to make it safe for a puppy. It turns out, most of my plants are poisonous to dogs! We bought a tiered shelf that will raise the plants higher than the puppy can reach.

* Tomorrow, we will be paying the rest of what we owe for the puppy. 

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about why you should care about your [financial profile](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/your-financial-profile-like-your-tinder-profile/) (aka, your credit score, credit history, credit report, etc.). 

## **What I’m Up To**

* I was quoted in [KaurSpace](https://kaurspace.com/magazine/01/manifesting-money-jane-harkness?fbclid=IwAR3ldMM6uOzGYb-ncFq5yAxestiNw9XNxx1jZv5qIstTbFnExZ2o6YLpNOc) about money mindset, and why it's important.

* On Wednesday, March 6th, I will be at the [Lemon Collective](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aligning-your-money-with-your-values-tickets-54778910195) leading a workshop on how to align your money with your values.

* On Tuesday, March 12th, I will be at [Mindspace](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-tickets-55047193638) leading a workshop called Making & Breaking the Budget. If you struggle with creating and sticking to a budget, this one is for you!

* On Wednesday, March 27th, I’ll be hosting Money Circle. We’ll be joined by personal style coach, [Allison Hamilton-Rohe](https://dailyoutfit.com/), since our topic is: [How To Create a Powerful Personal Style On A Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-create-a-powerful-personal-style-on-a-budget-tickets-54939672038).

## **What I’m Excited About**

* Dan and I are finally getting a puppy this weekend! We drove down to Richmond last weekend to meet a corgi puppy and we loved him on sight. We are driving back down first thing tomorrow to pick him up and take him home with us. Follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maggiegermano/) to see how cute he is! I'll also take any advice or resources that you have on how to raise a puppy.
