As I've mentioned over the past several weeks, October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. This month is not the only time that we should be fighting domestic violence, but it is a good time to really bring it to the forefront of people's minds. But just in case you want to continue doing your part in understanding domestic violence, reducing its prevalence, and helping survivors, this article is for you. It's all about what YOU can do to support victims of domestic violence. This can be in the form of money, or time, or energy. It's up to you to decide how you can contribute, but here are some ways to start.

## Show Your Friends That They Can Come to You

One of the reasons that people can feel trapped in an abusive relationship is that they have become isolated from their loved ones. They might feel like they have no one to turn to. In many cases, that is by the abuser's design. If someone feels alone and isolated, they might feel like their abuser is the only person they have, thus keeping them in the relationship. But if a victim knows that there are people to turn to, they may be more likely to leave when they decide to. If you have friends who might be in abusive relationships, even if you've become distanced from them, let them know if they can rely on you. Make it clear that you are sympathetic to abuse victims and won't blame them for their circumstances. You never know when they might need you.

## Donate to Advocacy Organizations

There are so many organizations out there that exist to help abuse victims, either by advocating for policy, providing services, or raising awareness. These organizations are often nonprofits that only survive because of generous donations. If you want to help and you have the financial resources to do so, consider building donations into your monthly or annual budget. 

Here are just a few wonderful organizations to start with:

* [The National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/)

* [Purple Purse](https://www.purplepurse.com/)

* [National Network to End Domestic Violence](https://nnedv.org/)

* [The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence](https://www.ncadv.org/)

* [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/)

## Volunteer at a Shelter

According to the [HHS](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/fysb/resource/dv-homelessness-stats-2016), in just one day in 2015, over 31,500 adults and children fleeing domestic violence found refuge in a domestic violence emergency shelter or transitional housing program. On that same day, these programs were unable to meet over 12,000 requests for services due to lack of funding, staffing or other resources. Furthermore, emergency shelter and transitional housing continue to be the most urgent unmet needs for domestic violence survivors.

These stats are why it's so important to donate to the above organizations and shelters. However, if you can't afford to donate your own money, consider donating your time. For a couple
