I've written [in the past](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-are-your-options-for-debt-consolidation/) about using a balance transfer in order to consolidate your debt or lower your interest rates. It is a method that I often hear about from my friends and clients. 

**Pros:**

* No interest

* More time to pay off your debt

**Cons:**

* Origination fee

* Time limit

* More credit
