Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* One of my clients' monthly payments came through this week.

* We have an Airbnb guest coming tonight and staying through Monday.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* On Sunday, Dan and I bought a bunch of healthy food at Safeway. We've had a really hard time eating well since we moved into our house, and with the wedding almost two months away, we want to get down to business. I also bought a few supplemental things on Amazon that night.

* On Monday, I had a doctor's appointment, so I paid the small co-pay for that.

* As with every week, I bought several small items for the wedding. I bought table numbers, tags that will go on guests' drinking glasses, and a dress bag for my wedding dress. 

* I had lunch with my friend, Nina, yesterday. We ate at SweetGreen.

* Yesterday, I attended my friend Rachel's bachelorette party. It was a tea party at Lady Camilla's Tea House in Georgetown, and was so much fun!

* Today, we were charged for this week's pre-marital counseling appointment. 

## What I’m Writing

* On my blog this week, I wrote about how to deal with [being jealous](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-deal-when-youre-jealous-of-your-friends-finances/) of your friends' financial situations.

* Over at my [Women@Forbes column](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/), I wrote about [how to avoid lifestyle inflation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2018/08/29/how-to-avoid-unnecessary-income-creep/) as you earn more money throughout your career. If you haven't already, follow my column so that you'll always know when I publish a new piece!

## What I’m Up To

* I was on the [Be Heard podcast](https://thebeheardpodcast.com/ep23/) this week! Tune in to hear me talk with Shana about getting your money right. 

* The [September Money Circle meetup](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/starting-early-planning-and-saving-for-holiday-spending/) is scheduled and ready for you to sign up! Next month, we’ll be meeting to discuss how to plan ahead and save for holiday season. See you there?

* I’m holding my first official budgeting workshop! On Saturday, September 15th, we’ll be gathering at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/) in Petworth, DC to learn how to budget! Sign up for the [Making & Breaking the Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) workshop today! This is for you if you’ve always struggled to stick to a budget, and you want to find a budgeting framework that works for you.

## What I’m Excited About

* My friends Rachel and Paul are getting married this weekend! I can't wait to go down to Luray, Virginia to celebrate them.

* My bachelorette party is next weekend! I'm excited to have my family and dear friends come down from New York and mingle with my DC friends. We'll be riding a shuttle around to a few different DC breweries and cideries. 

## Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
