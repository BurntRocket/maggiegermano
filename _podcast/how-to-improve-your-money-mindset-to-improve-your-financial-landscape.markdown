In this episode, in honor of September, which is Mental Health Awareness Month, we are talking about how you can begin to improve your money mindset and your relationship with money. One of the most important takeaways from this conversation is that we are all imperfect human beings who need to embrace self-compassion and patience as we try to improve our financial circumstances. If you’re ready to improve your own relationship with money while still being kind to yourself, this episode is for you.
