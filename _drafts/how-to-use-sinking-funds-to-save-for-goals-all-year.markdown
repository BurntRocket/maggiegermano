Happy Financial Literacy Month! You know I'm trying to teach you about money all year long, but this month, money nerds like me go even harder on the advice. For my part, I will be writing about specific, concrete financial questions I've gotten from clients or followers in the past. This week, I'm writing about "sinking funds". To be honest, I'd never heard of that term until Money Circle this past January when an attendee asked about it. But even though I've never heard the term, I'm very familiar with the idea and I actually write and talk about it all the time.

A sinking fund is a savings account that is built up over time by setting smaller amounts of money aside to build up to the larger amount. I talk about this approach all the time when talking about saving money or even paying for annual expenses. It's a pretty simple strategy, but it does take some planning and fine-tuning.

## Identify the Goal

What do you want to save up for? Is it a trip? A wedding? Gifts for holiday season? Your car insurance payment? Anything that you know you can't cover in a given month, or that will blow up your budget when it's due, is worth planning and saving for. But it's important to get clear on what those things are for you. It can be something fun or it can be something important. Either way, you'll feel better knowing you have a plan to get there.

## Do the Math

How much money do you have to save up to reach your goal? Do the necessary research to come up with a number. Look through your banking statements to see how much you paid for something last year. Once you come up with a clear number to work towards, you'll be able to take the right steps to get you there. 

## Save Monthly

Once you have the full number for your goal (or multiple goals) break that number down by month. How much do you have to set aside each month to reach your goal by your deadline?
