## How I Earned Money This Week

* Our basement Airbnb is bumping this month! Several payment from February and from the first week of March will be deposited into our bank account this week. I was really nervous about renting out our basement and not having much luck, but it actually seems to be doing really well. 

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I hate that I'm always complaining about homeowner woes here, but our dishwasher broke! I knew I wanted to replace the one that came with the house, but I didn't think we'd have to do it so soon. So we used some of our dedicated house savings to buy a new, stainless steel, dishwasher. I'm hoping it's really as quiet as the ad said it is!
