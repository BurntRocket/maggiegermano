Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my clients' monthly payment went through.

* A new client signed up for a one-time coaching session.

* We had guests stay in our Airbnb for most of the week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Hoo boy, this was a big wedding spending week. We ordered our wedding invitations (!!!), which was a bigger expense than I wanted it to be (check out my post about that). But I can't wait to see them because Dan designed them and they'll be beautiful. I'm also trying to check a bunch of little things off my list, so I ordered some random items for the wedding, including some decorations and gifts for the bridal party. 

* We also spent a whole lot of money on our honeymoon this week! I am too excited to be stressed about that, though. Plus, we have a travel savings account where we are pulling all of that money from, so it isn't coming out of our normal budget. We booked our lodging in Chiang Mai and Bangkok, we booked our visit to the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary (!!!), and we booked our travel from Bangkok to Koh Lipe and then from Koh Lipe to Chiang Mai. It's getting really real!

* Last night, Dan and I went to the Anthem for the first time. We saw Sylvan Esso in concert. It was a delayed anniversary gift from me to him. To make a real date of it, we went to Kaliwa for dinner. It was delicious!

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about [unemployment benefits](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/should-you-file-for-unemployment/) and when you may or may not qualify for them. If you've recently been laid off, make sure you check it out!

## **What I’m Up To**

* I'm holding my first official workshop! On Saturday, September 15th, we'll be gathering at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/) in Petworth, DC to learn how to budget! Sign up for the [Making & Breaking the Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) workshop today!

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/) is planned and available for registration! We’ll be focusing on homebuying for first-timers, and we’ll be joined by the wonderful real estate agent (and dear friend) Liz Delgado-Steo. Liz is great at breaking down the homebuying process into language you can understand, so this is a meetup you can’t miss! [Register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-homebuying-for-newbies-tickets-48132651055)!

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

![It feels really natural to want to avoid your money problems. But that doesn't make them go away. In fact, it makes them even worse. So open up that bill that's been sitting on your counter. Call the creditor back.
