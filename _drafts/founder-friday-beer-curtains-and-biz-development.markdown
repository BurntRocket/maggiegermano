Happy Friday!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We took a few days off from our Airbnb this week so we'd have time alone in the house to regroup after vacation. But we have a new family in the space this week, and they're staying for 5 nights.

* I sold a one-time client session scheduled for next week!

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Sunday, we went to a surprise birthday party for a friend at [Bar Roubaix](http://www.roubaixdc.com/). We drank a little bit too much and spent about $60, but the plus side was that we had cash left over from our vacation, which we used to pay for the booze.

* After the birthday party, Dan and I went to Target and bought a few sets of curtains. We bought sheer white curtains for the dining room, which already spruced up the space quite a bit. And we bought light gray blackout curtains for our bedroom. I don't know about you, but I need pitch dark at night, and I'm excited to hang these curtains!

* I made a big investment in my business this week. I joined the [Signed](https://www.smartgetspaid.com/signed/) course with [Leah Neaderthal](https://www.smartgetspaid.com/about/) so that I can grow my business and get more clients. We had our kickoff call on Tuesday and I'm so excited to see where this course helps me take my business!
