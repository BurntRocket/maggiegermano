Congratulations! You paid off some or all of your debt! I bet it felt like this day would never come. But you stuck to it, you made sacrifices, and you reached your goal. But you might be wondering what you should (or shouldn't) do next. And this point in time is actually really important, because it could determine whether you stay out of debt or whether you end up back in debt later. So here are some basics for what to do now.

## Stop Using Your Credit Cards

If it's credit card debt you've paid off, this is the most important thing to do afterwards. After paying off credit card debt, it can be easy to start racking up that debt again. This is a dangerous cycle to get trapped in. If you've struggled with overspending and credit card debt in the past, do yourself a favor and stop using your credit cards all together. [Set up a budget](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-create-a-budget-that-works-for-you/) based on your income and expenses and use cash or debit only. It might feel limiting or scary at first, but this will protect you from going back into debt after working so hard to get out of it. If you need to cut up your cards to stop yourself from using them, do it! And make sure to remove your credit card information from online shopping portals like Amazon.

## Keep Your Credit Card Accounts Open

Just because you've paid off your debt and stopped using credit cards doesn't mean you have to close your accounts. The length of your credit history and the credit limit available to you is really helpful to your [credit score](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/care-about-your-credit-score). And your credit score is important when it comes to future financial decisions like buying a car or a home. So even if you're going to stop using your credit cards, keep the accounts themselves open so that they can help improve your credit score. If you don't want the temptation of the cards, cut them up or give them to a trusted friend to lock away. They can be open even if they aren't available to you! If you're worried about your credit company closing your account and hurting your credit, set up your credit card to pay for a small recurring payment, like your Netflix account. Be sure to also set up auto-pay so you don't forget about it and get charged late fees and interest! This is an easy way to keep your accounts active without actually using them day-to-day.

## Revisit Your Budget

You should revisit your budget every couple months or so to make sure it's working for you. But this is especially important to do when you've had a big financial change happen. This can be a pay increase, decrease, a new expense, or when you've paid off a debt. When you've paid off a portion (or all) of your debt, it's a good time to revisit your [budget](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/budgeting-101/) and see how things are going.

Figure out exactly what bills you have to pay each month (and throughout the year) now that you don't have your debt. If you have another debt that you want to start working for, move the money that was going towards your past debt to your other debt. Increasing the monthly payments will allow you to pay off the debt faster. If you don't have another debt to work towards, decide where you want that money to go. It can be tempting to start spending more, but it will be more rewarding to align your money with your [values](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/do-your-habits-and-values-align/) and set yourself up for success later.

## Allocate That Money Towards Your Goals

You've paid off your debt, congratulations! You now have much more money available to you to use for anything you want. But be careful not to just start spending all of that money every month. In fact, you've lived without it while paying off your debt, so what can you put it towards now that will help you? The best opportunity here is to start putting it into savings. This can be an emergency savings account or retirement savings. This is especially important if you haven't been able to save for these things up until now. Automate this savings so that you aren't tempted to spend the money now that it's in your account!
