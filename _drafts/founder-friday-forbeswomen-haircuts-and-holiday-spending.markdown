Happy Friday! I hope you've been staying warm now that's it's for real winter. Here's what I was up to this week. 

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We had three different Airbnb guests stay with us this week and through the weekend.

* Money Circle was this week, and the Eventbrite payout is in process.

* Dan's bi-weekly paycheck came in today.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I worked downtown a few times this week, in between meetings. I bought myself lunch at BiBap in Dupont Circle, and bought some hot chocolate at Emissary. 

* One of my favorite singers, [LP](http://iamlp.com/), is coming to DC in February! Tickets went on sale yesterday, so I got tickets for Dan and me. Her last show here sold out before I could buy tickets, so I made it a priority this time.

* I hadn't gotten a haircut since July, so it was definitely time for one. I had grown my hair out a bit for the wedding, and was missing my short hair. So I went to [Bubbles Salon](http://www.bubblessalons.com/) near Union Station for a cut. I'm not super thrilled with how it turned out, so I might need a touch up after Christmas. Do you have a favorite hair stylist in DC or Maryland? I'm on the hunt for a new one that I can trust!

* Last night, I went to a holiday happy hour for the women's entrepreneur group that I'm in. (It's called [Feminist Founder](https://www.feministfounder.com/), and if you're a self-employed lady in the DC-area, you should join!) I got a beer, pot stickers, and bacon wrapped dates (yus). 

## **What I’m Writing**

My latest piece on [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2018/12/11/investors-think-they-are-fair-but-minority-owned-businesses-are-left-out/) is up! This week, I wrote about a new report that shows the discrepancy between how investors *think* they are making funding decisions and what is *really* happening. Spoiler: women and minority-owned businesses get the short end of the stick.

## **What I’m Up To**

* The December [Money Circle](http://maggiegermano.com/moneycircle) meetup was this week! We got really worked up talking about the stresses and expectations around holiday gift-giving. Stay tuned for a special Money Circle in January!
