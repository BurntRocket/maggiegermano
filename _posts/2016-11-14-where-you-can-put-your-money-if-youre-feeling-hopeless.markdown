Whew. Last week was a tough one. I'm not sure about all of you, but I was (and still am) heartbroken about the outcome of our presidential election. I really thought that love, progress, and inclusivity would win out. But as a country, we are not there yet.

HOWEVER.

There is still so much we can do. We've taken the past week to be angry and mournful, but now it's time to take productive action. Donating to organizations that fight for the issues you care about is a good first step.

Here are some wonderful organizations that you can donate to, broken out by the issue they represent. If there are any missing that you support, email me!

If your income or budget don't allow for you to donate to all of the organizations that you love (I know mine doesn't!), there are other things you can do.

First, figure out how much money you are able to allocate for donations without going over budget. Next, sign up to volunteer for organizations in your city! Then, pay attention. Sign up for the organizations' newsletters and follow them on social media. That way, you'll know when they need you the most, whether for donations, signing petitions, joining protests, or volunteering. This doesn't end here.
