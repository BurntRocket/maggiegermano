Just in time for Valentine's Day, there's been [a study](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123005479/en/Stop-Arguing-Financial-Tips-Couples) released by Elevate’s [Center for the New Middle Class](https://newmiddleclass.org/blog/) about love and money. As you may have heard, financial problems are one of the leading causes of relationship strife. But it doesn't have to be that way! I'm a [huge proponent](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/have-the-money-talk) for talking openly about money with your partner (and everyone else in your life!) Money touches every part of our lives, so it's important to get on the same page with the person you're sharing your life with. 

Do you, like 21 percent of the marriages in this study, exhibit behaviors of unhealthy financial partnership? This can look like:

* Failing to reach financial compromises

* Not comfortable talking with each other about finances

* Feeling that their partner does not support their financial goals

* Not understanding each other’s position in arguments

But it doesn't have to be this way! Even if this is how your relationship has felt so far, there are changes that you can make to improve things. 

## Discuss Your Financial Goals

## Define Family Goals, If You Have Them

## Be Transparent 

According to the survey, 24 percent of respondents say they are not confident that their partner is entirely honest about their spending with them. Wow! That's almost a quarter of respondents. 

Of course, you don't have to report back to your partner for every dollar you spend. That would be obnoxious. And if you have a partner who demands that, there might be a [much bigger issue](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/financial-abuse-survivors-want-you-to-know) at hand. 

## Combine Some of Your Finances

## Be Empathetic
