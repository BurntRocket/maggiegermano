Before it gets so cold that you hibernate for 3 months (hellooo Netflix), you should go get your fill of outdoor activities! Many of these are also very Instagram worthy. Check it out!

## 1. Apple picking

In some places, apples may already be out of season. But if they're not, visit a local apple orchard. It's nice to be outside, picking your own fruit, AND there are a lot of wonderful things you can make with your apples. Homemade [applesauce](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/homemade-applesauce/), [apple cider](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Apple-Cider) (or [apple cider sangria](https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/11/apple-cider-sangria/)), [apple crisp](https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/03/multigrain-apple-crisps/), [apple pie](https://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11/cinnamon-sigh/), [apple pancakes](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/apple-pancakes/)... (I'm so hungry now.)

## 2. Pumpkin picking

I know today is [Halloween](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3vRfhFD8hJCiP0uQ/giphy.gif) so pumpkin carving is a little overdue, but pumpkin picking is still fun! Sometimes, apples and pumpkins can be picked at the [same place](http://www.hollinfarms.com/). You can use your pumpkins and gourds as autumn decorations, and also gut them for their [delicious seeds](http://ohsheglows.com/2012/09/17/how-to-roast-perfect-pumpkin-seeds-easy-crunchy-addictive/).

## 2. Visit a vineyard

Depending on where you are in the United States, chances are you're within driving distance of a vineyard or two. You can take a tour of the vineyard and have a tasting of their wines. It's likely to also be a beautiful place, so [find one near you](http://www.allamericanwineries.com/AAWMain/locate.htm)!

## 4. Hiking

I like hiking when it's cooler outside because I sweat a lot less. I also love to see all the changing leaves around me. Do some research on [local hiking trails](http://dcist.com/2016/06/the_dc_regions_best_hikes.php) or [state and national parks](https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm). Soak in the fresh, crisp air before it gets too cold!

## 5. Camping

When I was growing up, my family went camping at the end of October every year. So, I'm accustomed to camping when it's a little cold outside (or freezing, since we were in upstate New York). I think camping when it's chilly is more pleasant than when it's hot. It's not for everyone, but if you think you might like it, find a [local campground](http://www.recreation.gov/recFacilityActivitiesHomeAction.do?goto=camping.htm).
