As an engaged couple, we were feeling nervous about the process of merging our finances. Thankfully, Maggie was a great listener, making sure she got all the facts of our situation before we even met. Then she was so thorough in preparing for our meeting, and her approach allowed us to explore our differing attitudes and beliefs about money. We left with concrete tools, feeling empowered to have further conversations on our own. We learned about budgeting, and about each other!
