## How I Earned Money This Week

* Our basement Airbnb is bumping this month! Several payment from February and from the first week of March will be deposited into our bank account this week. I was really nervous about renting out our basement and not having much luck, but it actually seems to be doing really well.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I hate that I'm always complaining about homeowner woes here, but our dishwasher broke! I knew I wanted to replace the one that came with the house, but I didn't think we'd have to do it so soon. So we used some of our dedicated house savings to buy a new, stainless steel, dishwasher. I'm hoping it's really as quiet as the ad said it is!

## **What I’m Writing**

* This month is Women's History Month, and I'm focusing all my blog posts on women and the issues that affect them. This week, I wrote about the [financial impact of sexual harassment and abuse](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/the-financial-impact-of-sexual-harassment-abuse/). Please read it and let me know what you think.

* I also teamed up with a fantastic group of women for #WomenRockMoney on International Women's Day. [Check out my blog post](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/womenrockmoney/), which outlines my top 3 pieces of advice for women who want to start the journey to financial wellness. 

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I was on the second episode of the new Bossed Up podcast! Emilie and I answered a listener's question about when and how to leave a job.
