- How to Manage Finances Once You're Married

Before I bought a house with my now-husband, I felt very strongly about keeping our finances separate. I thought that in order to be independent, I couldn't combine anything. Yes, we already had a shared credit card for things like groceries or dining, but that didn't really count, because he was just an authorized user on my account. However, once we bought a house, and especially once I quit my job and took my business full-time, things got more financially complicated. We were relying on Dan's salary to pay our bills, so it wasn't as simple as me paying all the bills and then Dan transferring what he owed me to my account. In fact, it was impossible for us to do that. And just because Dan was now the main breadwinner didn't mean that he wanted to take over managing our finances. So the solution was to open a joint checking account and have most of Dan's paychecks deposit into it and have all of our bills get pulled from it. 

## Keep Your Own Checking Account

Even though Dan and I primarily use our joint checking account for paying for things, we each maintain our own, separate checking accounts. We can do whatever we want with that money without having to answer to each other and it lets us feel a semblance of independence. 

## Keep Your Own Emergency Savings

Emergency savings isn't just protection for when you lose your job, get injured, or your car breaks down. It's also there for you if your relationship breaks down and you need to find a new place to live ASAP. Of course, you hope the worst won't happen, but 50 percent of marriages do end in divorce, so it's not unrealistic that it might happen someday. 

Dan and I each have our own emergency funds, and neither of us have access to the other's. Recently, we used some excess savings money to purchase a new car, and then we split up what was left so that we would each have the same amount in our savings. Of course, we can use this money together if something were to happen to our home or health, but it's also there for each of us if something were to go wrong between us. 

## Have Regular Money Check-Ins

## Set Ground Rules

As adults, we don't necessarily have to check in with our partner for every little expense. In fact, if your partner requires you to get permission or explain yourself whenever you spend money, you might be experiencing [financial abuse](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-you-should-know-about-financial-abuse/). However, when you're sharing your life and your money with someone else, it's important to have transparency and ground rules.
