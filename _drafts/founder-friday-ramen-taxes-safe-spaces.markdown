TGIF! I don't know about you, but I'm ready for spring. The unrelenting wind makes it pretty hard for me to get outside. 

## How I Earned Money This Week

* Two of my clients' monthly payments went through this week.

* I got a brand new client!

* We had so many Airbnb guests this week! Now that we're fairly established as hosts, the payments go through on the day that the guests check in.

* I finally filed my taxes! This year was tough, because so much has changed. I bought a house, changed states, and increased my self-employment revenue. Luckily, I'm getting a hefty tax refund, and the majority of it will go towards our wedding savings.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I celebrated our 4th anniversary this Wednesday (Pi Day ftw)! We had dinner at the wonderful [Toki Underground](https://www.tokiunderground.com/).

* I have a bit of a candy addiction, and I'm really trying to kick it... but this week didn't go very well because I bought a bag of [Hershey's Hugs](https://www.hersheys.com/en_us/products/hersheys-hugs-candies-12-ounce.html). 

* We're having friends over for dinner tonight, so I'll be going to the grocery store in a few minutes to get cheese and crackers and some ramen fixings. Is it too much to have ramen twice in one week? No shade, but Dan's homemade ramen is better than Toki's. 

* I'm excited for our [Hungry Harvest](https://www.hungryharvest.net/) delivery this week! I'm trying out the Organic Valley vanilla yogurt I added to our order. Haven't heard of Hungry Harvest? They rescue food that's been rejected by grocery stores and sell it to you for less. This is how they work towards their mission of [eliminating food waste](https://www.hungryharvest.net/eliminating-food-waste/). They also work to [end hunger](https://www.hungryharvest.net/ending-hunger) by selling their reduced-cost produce at SNAP markets and donating food to organizations like [Capital Area Food Bank](https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/) and [Martha's Table](http://marthastable.org/).

## What I’m Writing

It's Women's History Month, so I'm focusing on issues that affect women financially. This week, I wrote about the [wage gap](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/the-truth-about-the-wage-gap/), and the things you might not know about it. Check it out and let me know what you think!

## What I’m Excited About

* I'm speaking at [The Sisterhood Project](https://www.facebook.com/events/769338589936455/) at the Line Hotel in Washington, DC this Sunday! I'm excited to be speaking to women in the hospitality industry about personal finance and how to manage their money. All are welcome, it's free, and the event is sponsored by [Fords Gin](https://www.facebook.com/FordsGin/) and [Del Maguey Single Village Mezcal](https://www.facebook.com/delmaguey/). See you there?

* Tickets for Collective Action for Safe Spaces' [Safe Space Jam](https://collectiveactiondc.givezooks.com/events/safe-space-jam-2018) are officially on sale! Early bird tickets are available until March 24th. CASS works everyday to make DC a safer place for everyone, and this annual event is a great way to support their work, meet the community, and bid on some great silent auction items. I hope to see you there! PS: if you're not in the DC area, you can still support CASS by [donating](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/collectiveactiondc).

* I'm leading a personal finance workshop at Varnish Lane nail salon for their first Varnish Lane After Hours event! Join us on [Thursday, April 5th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/varnish-lane-after-hours-personal-finances-tickets-44203571071)!

## What I’m Fan-Girling Over

* [Invoice the Patriarchy](http://www.artpatti.com/invoice-the-patriarchy/): Artist and stay-at-home mom Patti Maciesz started this project to show the impact of the unpaid labor that women do all the time. You can [calculate what your own salary](https://www.billthepatriarchy.com/) would be, based on all the unpaid labor that you do everyday. 

* [Missing & Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams and Finding Cleo](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/missing-murdered-who-killed-alberta-williams/). I listen to a LOT of podcasts. And many of them are true crime and/or investigative podcasts. And I've noticed that most of these podcasts are made by, about, and for white people. People of color are nearly invisible in this genre. However, with podcasts like Missing & Murdered, hopefully that is starting to change. This podcast is led by investigative reporter and Indigenous woman, [Connie Walker](http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/meet-our-team-connie-walker-1.2449140). In the two seasons so far, Connie investigates the murders of two different Indigenous women. I'm grateful to her for shining a light on these stories and searching for justice.

## Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend

* Happy St. Patrick's Day! This year, make a spending plan before you go out to celebrate. Look at your budget and decide how much you can spend this weekend without hurting your bank account. From there, take that amount out in cash and leave your cards at home. This will help you stay on budget and probably prevent you from being too hungover on Sunday.

That's all from me for this week! Stay safe and warm this weekend!
