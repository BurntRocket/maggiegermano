tweet: Buying a home is part of the American Dream. But do you really know what it
  entails?

Oh, homebuying. It's sold to us as the American Dream. And it really is great to know that you own your home, and that you aren't just giving your money to a landlord or management company. I often read about older generations scold Millennials for not being able to buy our own homes. But it isn't just young people being too lazy or bad with money. The housing bubble burst when we were just entering the workforce. Banks are more squeamish about giving out mortgages. Costs are higher! I don't fault anyone for not being able to or not wanting to go through this process. 

In fact, the only reason my fiance and I were able to buy a house is because I received a settlement for an injury

## Your real estate agent matters

When Dan and I first started looking at houses, we weren't very serious about it. We didn't have the money for the down payment yet, so we just wanted to see what was out there. We started off booking tours via Redfin, and didn't have our own real estate agent. We thought we had plenty of time to find one before we found a house we loved. But then we fell in love with the eight house we looked at. It was the right price, and we wanted to make an offer on it before anyone else did. In order to do that, we decided to sign a contract with the Redfin agent in the area. Ultimately, that house was bought by someone else (in cash!). But we had already signed a contract, so we continued to look at houses with the Redfin agent.

Everything turned out fine, but we didn't feel like our agent knew what we really wanted. She didn't send us houses that we loved or were particularly interested in. We were usually picking out houses on our own and then she would meet us there. At first, I thought that was fine, because I was able to be more in control of the process. As time went on, though, it was exhausting to be doing all the leg work. One of the reasons you hire a real estate agent is that they do the searching for you.

\(If you're in DC, might I recommend connecting with my real estate agent friend Liz Delgado-Steo. She's wonderful, funny, and really has your best interest in mind when it comes to buying a home.)

## Dealbreakers aren't always dealbreakers

## The process isn't quick or easy

## Closing costs are super expensive

Ever wonder how your parents or grandparents were able to buy a house? Well I think I found the secret. In years past, people were able to buy houses without a big downpayment and without closing costs. That meant they just had to get approved for the mortgage by the bank and then pay every month! Now, we have to come up with up to 20% of the cost of the home, or else we have to pay private mortgage insurance. Not only that, but we have to pay huge closing costs once we sign for the house. Closing costs tend to be about 3% of the cost of the house. If you're buying a $300,000 house, that's quite a bit of cash! 

This was not something I was initially aware of, and it kind of knocked me on my ass when I realized the number. Luckily, when we were making an offer on our house, we requested that the sellers pay for most of the closing costs. They agreed, and then a repair credit from them covered the rest. 

## Looking for a house is very emotional
