*This is part three of my celebration of women during Womenâ€™s History Month. Read my piece about philanthropists [here](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/10-Amazing-Philanthropists-Uplifting-Other-Women/) and my piece about entrepreneurs [here](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/5-kickass-entrepreneurs-getting-your-money-right/).*

The results of the 2016 presidential election were (and still are) pretty hard to stomach. I desperately wanted to see Hillary Clinton as our first woman president, but I also don't think she was our first and only hope. This Women's History Month, let's celebrate a few other politicians who will help change the world.

## Elizabeth Warren

[Senator Elizabeth Warren](https://www.warren.senate.gov/) (D-MA) has been in the news recently, thanks to Mitch McConnell. I'm sure you've heard by now that she was warned, she was given an explanation. Nevertheless, [she persisted](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-nevertheless-she-persisted-trnd/). But before Senator Warren gained infamy during Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing, she made a name for herself in other ways.

Warren is an active consumer protection advocate whose input led to the conception and establishment of the [U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/). Following the 2008 financial crisis, Warren served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the [Troubled Asset Relief Program](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/Pages/default.aspx) (TARP). In 2012, she won her Senatorial race against Senator Scott Brown (R-MA). Since then, she has been an outspoken advocate for the American people.

## Kamala Harris

[Senator Kamala Harris](https://www.harris.senate.gov/) (D-CA) is the junior Senator in California, having won her election in November 2016. Before that, she was the California Attorney General - the first female, African-American, or Indian-American AG in the state's history. In that role, Harris was an advocate for homeowner's rights and children's issues. Since becoming a Senator, Harris has sworn to protect immigrants, and has spoken out against several of Trump's cabinet nominees. 

## Tammy Duckworth
