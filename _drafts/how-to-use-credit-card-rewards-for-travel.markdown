**Disclaimer: **While I fully take advantage of credit card rewards programs, credit cards are not for everyone. If you struggle with debt and overspending, you probably shouldn't sign up for rewards cards. The interest rates tend to be much higher, so if you can't pay off your card in full every month, you'll end up spending a lot more money in interest over time.
