As you may have seen in past posts or on social media, my husband and I are in the process of getting a puppy! Dan has desperately wanted a dog for as long as I've known him. I came to the desire more gradually. I grew up with cats and wasn't around dogs very often, unless I was at one of my cousins' houses. I also had a few negative experiences with big dogs when I was younger (and very small), so I've always been a big hesitant when it comes to dogs. Dan wore me down over the years with his exuberance about corgis and now I want one too!

A lot of the conversation around getting a dog has been related to money (can you believe it?). Since we were initially planning to buy a corgi from a breeder, we knew that it was going to be a decent financial investment. We also learned that dog owners typically spend around $1,600 on their dog in the first year of owning them. I wanted to overestimate how much we thought we would spend and save it up ahead of time.

We also had a few changes to make to our house before we felt comfortable getting a dog. The fence in our backyard was rotting and falling over in several places. There was no way we'd feel good putting a puppy back there without it escaping. So we decided to replace the fence before we got the dog. As you can imagine, this is quite the additional expense.

Your situation might be very different from ours, but there are still many questions you should answer for yourself before you go to a rescue and pick out a puppy.

## Make Sure You Can Afford One

Just like with having a child, adopting an animal might cost more money than you were expecting. Do your research and find out how much it usually costs both up front and annually to care for a pet. You should specify based on the type of pet you want to get.

## Decide If You Want to Buy or Adopt

This is a contentious topic with a lot of people. For many, it is an ethical question. Why buy from a breeder when there are countless animals out there who need to be rescued and adopted? However, sometimes you know exactly what you want, and you won't necessarily be able to find that animal at a rescue. 

There is also a huge difference in terms of affordability. When you choose an animal from a rescue, the fees are going to be lower, and usually the pet is already spayed or neutered and given its shots. When you buy from a breeder, the fees will likely be much higher, and won't always include neutering and shots. That means that on top of the fee, you will also have to pay to have these things done at your local veterinarian.

## Don't Buy All the Cute Items That You See

A few weeks ago, I told my husband that I was worried he'd want to buy every artsy dog accessory he saw. Well, not too long after that, he texted me say that I was right, and that Instagram was targeting him hard with their ads. When I shared that anecdote with friends, one of them warned me not to buy too much stuff for a puppy. She said "they will either destroy it or outgrow it". And this is an important thing to remember! It's easy to get carried away when you have a cute animal at home and want to spoil it with all the shiny things out there.
