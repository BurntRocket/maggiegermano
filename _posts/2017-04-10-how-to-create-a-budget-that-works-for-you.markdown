Happy Financial Literacy Month! This week, I want to talk to you about creating a budget that works for you. Just like with healthy eating and exercise habits, it's hard to stick to a budget. That's usually because we are trying to stick to a budget that doesn't make sense for us.

## Identify your financial goals

It'll be a lot easier to stick to a budget if you know what you're doing it for. Sticking to a budget for budget's sake is a recipe for failure. 

What is most important to you moving forward? Do you want to make changes in your career, love life, friendships, financial situation, etc.? Pick out those overarching goals, and then you can figure out how to achieve them.

Youâ€™re much more likely to reach your goals if you identify them and then write them down. If these goals are big, break them down into digestible steps. This will make it much less intimidating, and also feel more attainable.

Now that you know your goals, you can build your budget to help you reach them.
