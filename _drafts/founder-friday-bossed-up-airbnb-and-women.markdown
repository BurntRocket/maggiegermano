Happy Friday! We made it!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* Our basement Airbnb is bumping this month! Several payment from February and from the first week of March will be deposited into our bank account this week. I was really nervous about renting out our basement and not having much luck, but it actually seems to be doing really well.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I hate that I'm always complaining about homeowner woes here, but our dishwasher broke! I knew I wanted to replace the one that came with the house, but I didn't think we'd have to do it so soon. So we used some of our dedicated house savings to buy a new, stainless steel, dishwasher. I'm hoping it's really as quiet as the ad said it is!

* Dan had a speaking gig this week at [Creative Jam](https://nvite.com/CreativeJam/gwu2018) by Adobe. He got out of work early to prepare, so we went to [El Rey](https://elreydc.com/) in Shaw for some tacos and beer. Nom.

## **What I’m Writing**

* This month is Women's History Month, and I'm focusing all my blog posts on women and the issues that affect them. This week, I wrote about the [financial impact of sexual harassment and abuse](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/the-financial-impact-of-sexual-harassment-abuse/). Please read it and let me know what you think.

* I also teamed up with a fantastic group of women for #WomenRockMoney on International Women's Day. [Check out my blog post](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/womenrockmoney/), which outlines my top three pieces of advice for women who want to start the journey to financial wellness.

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I was on the second episode of the new [Bossed Up podcast](https://bossedup.org/episode02/)! Emilie and I answered a listener's question about when and how to leave a job.

* I'm teaming up with coach [Noelle Janka](http://www.noellejanka.com/) to lead a webinar on taking control of your money! [Join us on Wednesday, March 28th at 6:30pm](https://www.maggiegermano.com/other-events/webinar-how-to-take-control-of-your-money/)!

* I'm sponsoring the [Being Boss DC book launch party](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/being-boss-dc-book-launch-party-tickets-43800308903) in April! Join us on Friday, April 13th, to celebrate the release of this book, which is sure to be fantastic.

## **What I’m Fan-Girling Over**

* Our amazing wedding photographer, [Barbara Oliveira](http://www.barbaraophotography.com/), sent us our engagement photos already and they're perfect! They really show our personalities and relationship. I can only imagine how wonderful the wedding day photos will be.

## **Money Tips to Take Into the Weekend**

* Do some meal planning! Meal planning can feel overwhelming and terrible, but it really can save you money if you do it right. If you typically end up buying lunch or dinner because you don't have food prepared, pick out one or two recipes to get you through the week. I like to make a soup or chili that will last for several meals throughout the week. That way, I know that I have at least a few meals covered and won't be tempted to dine out.

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
