* I’m doing some thinking about what topics I want to cover in upcoming Money Circle meetups in Washington, DC. Send your preferences in **[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9h1xvbIg9UctjkOCfY7hWgAz5O1lOn07xX6ztEyiE3r96Uw/viewform?usp=sf_link)**!

* I’ve created a virtual **[Money Circle membership program](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)**! If you are not located in the DC area, or if you just want more connection through Money Circle, this program is for you. There are 3 tiers that offer different options at different price points. There is a group coaching component and even a level that lets you check in with me every month. **[Sign up today!](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)**
