## **Call Your Elected Officials**

If you think your local government hasn’t been doing enough to prevent and punish police brutality, let them know. Call your councilperson, your mayor, your county executive, your state legislator, your Congressperson. Let them know that you see what is happening and you are not okay with it. Let them know that the people in their community want things to change now.

## **Don't Call The Cops On Your Neighbors of Color**

As we’ve seen, time and again, the police aren’t always here to protect citizens of color. Remember that when you think about calling the police. Consider being an active bystander to interrupt tense situations, but do keep your own safety in mind. To learn more about being an active bystander, check out [Collective Action for Safe Spaces](https://maggiegermano.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7b0d49f10f1aef89a45167c3b&id=ab4209e774&e=ca1ae675af).

## **Get On The Front Lines At Protests**

Of course, we are still in the middle of a global pandemic, so if you are immunocompromised or you feel otherwise unsafe being in large groups of people right now, that’s okay. But if you feel comfortable joining in, go! Put yourself between black folks and the police. Show your black neighbors that you mean what you say when you say that black lives matter.

## **Spend Your Money At Black-Owned Businesses**

Financial empowerment is huge when it comes to uplifting communities. That’s why it’s so important to invest in Black-owned businesses in your area. A great place to start is this [central database](https://maggiegermano.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7b0d49f10f1aef89a45167c3b&id=80fc29c701&e=ca1ae675af) for Black-owned businesses.

**PS:** I want to interview experts on these topics:

* How white people and other non-Black people can be better allies to actually be anti-racist and fight against white supremacy and police violence

* Why Black wealth matters and how to even the financial playing field across race

* Why cash bail is racist and wrong and what should be instituted instead

* How allies can use their wallets to fight white supremacy and support their Black neighbors, friends, colleagues, family members, etc.

* How redlining has harmed Black families and prevented them from building wealth

* How and why real estate taxes should not determine school funding

Email me at [boss@maggiegermano.com](mailto:boss@maggiegermano.com) if you or someone you know wants to be interviewed on one or more of these topics!
