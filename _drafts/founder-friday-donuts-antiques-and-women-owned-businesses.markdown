Happy Friday, y'all! Is it just me, or do short weeks always feel the longest? Here's what I was up to during this short, rainy week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* I didn't have any client payments go through this week, but we had an Airbnb guest stay for 6 nights straight!

* This isn't my personal income, but Dan's paycheck came through this week. (ICYMI: Dan's income is the money that we're relying on for all of our fixed costs and flex spending. We're using my business income and Airbnb income for house updates and savings.)

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I spent Sunday and Monday in Frederick, MD. We spent most of our money on a cute bed and breakfast and an all-you-can-eat crab feast. But we did go to a few antique shops to poke around. I bought a couple small gifts, but otherwise the prices were much higher than we anticipated.

* I spent over $300 on donuts today. Not kidding! We're having donuts instead of cake for our wedding, and we confirmed and paid for our order. I can't wait to see 150 donuts set up at the wedding reception.

* My Smartrip card finally ran out of Smart Benefits from my last job, so I had to put more money on the card. 

* I haven't had a light in my home office for months, because we tried to replace the fixture and the wood beams in the ceiling are a little too broken up to drill into. We need to open the hole bigger and install the fixture to beams that haven't been drilled into 100 times. Of course, we're procrastinating on this task. So whenever it's cloudy out or getting dark, I basically sit in the dark in my office while I work. I finally gave in and bought myself a cute floor lamp for $60.

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about [how to stay in control of spending](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-stay-in-control-of-your-wedding-spending/) while you're wedding planning. Things can get out of hand very easily, so read up for my tips!

## What I’m Excited About

* As you read this, I'm speaking on a panel at [NCCWSL](https://www.nccwsl.org/) at the University of Maryland. The panel is called ["Secure Finances for a Secure Future"](https://www.nccwsl.org/about/workshops/) and I'll be joined by several other amazing women!

## What I’m Up To

* I don't own any orange clothing, so I'm not [wearing orange today](https://wearorange.org/), but I'm still supporting the movement to end gun violence. Join organizations like [Everytown for Gun Safety](https://everytown.org/) and the [Brady Campaign](http://www.bradycampaign.org/), who are working on this issue everyday. I had forgotten about this awareness day, until I saw a group of teenagers protesting gun violence by the White House yesterday. I snapped a few pictures (see below) and tried not to cry. The kids are alright. 

* The [June Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-make-a-budget/) event is up! We’ll be gathering to create our own budgets! I’ll be there to guide you and answer your questions. See you there?

* I’m teaming up with [General Assembly on Tuesday, June 26th](https://generalassemb.ly/education/mo-money-mo-worries-get-financially-savvy-in-2018/washington-dc/49127) for a free personal finance workshop. See you there?
