Happy Women's History Month! This is the one month out of the year that is dedicated to celebrating the contributions and achievements of women in America. Like with Black History Month, we should be celebrating women every day. But unfortunately, that's not the case (yet), so it's nice to take advantage of this month to elevate women and the issues affecting them.

Sexual harassment and abuse have been prominent in the news lately, thanks to the #MeToo movement. Up to 85% of women report that they have been sexually harassed at work, according to a 2016 [report](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/task_force/harassment/upload/report.pdf) by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Not only do these crimes affect women emotionally and physically, but they have a financial impact as well. Here are the ways sexual harassment and abuse affect women financially, which you may not have thought about before.

## Healthcare Costs

## Mental Health Repercussions

## Changing Industries

I've heard about this a lot during the #MeToo movement. Many women who started out in the entertainment industry left their career after experiencing sexual harassment or abuse in the workplace. Many of these women likely had extremely promising careers, but they no longer felt safe or wanted, so they left the industry. 

According to data collected by sociologist Heather McLaughlin and others, about [80% of women ](https://workinprogress.oowsection.org/2017/08/17/the-cost-of-sexual-harassment/)who have been harassed leave their jobs within two years. This happens everywhere: tech, education, law enforcement, etc. Not only is this incredibly tragic because it causes women to leave their preferred field, but it can also negatively impact their earning power. When you leave one industry and start over in a new one, you're starting from the bottom in terms of salary too. 

## Litigation

In the news, we often hear about multi-million dollar settlements. But the truth is, that usually doesn't happen. If it does happen, it is after much time, money, and struggle.
