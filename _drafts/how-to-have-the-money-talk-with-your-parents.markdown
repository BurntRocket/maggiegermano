Have you every considered that it's important to talk about money with your parents? And I don't mean talking to them about your own money. I mean talking to them about their money, their financial circumstances, and their future. If you're like many people, this probably hasn't really crossed your mind. In fact, this wasn't something I really considered until my own grandparents and parents started getting older. But it's incredibly important to be starting these conversations and getting on the same page with our family as we, and they, get older.

But the truth is, even though these conversations are essential, they can be really tough to have! So tough, in fact, that many people avoid them completely, to their detriment and that of their families. I want to help to change that, starting with you!

*If you want to learn more about having these conversations, and why they are so important, check out this week's [Money Circle podcast](www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/its-time-to-talk-money-with-your-parents/), where I chat with [Cameron Huddleston](https://cameronhuddleston.com/), author of [Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk](https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Dad-Need-Talk-Conversations/dp/111953836X).*
