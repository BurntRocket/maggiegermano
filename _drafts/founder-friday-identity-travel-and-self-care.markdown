Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had two different Airbnb guests this week.

* Dan's paycheck came in this week.

* No business income to speak of!

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* We're leaving for our honeymoon in just over a week, so I'm doing some last minute buying of things we will need. I bought travel sized bug spray and sunscreen, and a shoulder bag that can attach to my new Away bag.

* I got a massage this morning! I've been pretty stressed lately, so I've noticed a ton of tension and pain in my jaw and shoulder. I decided to invest in self care by getting a massage from my favorite massage therapist (go see Layne at [Aura Spa](https://auraspa.net/)!). I don't regret it!

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about the controversial topic of the name change after marriage! Spoiler alert: I'm not changing mine. [Check it out](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/why-im-keeping-my-name-after-i-get-married/) and let me know what you think!

## **What I’m Up To**

* I was quoted in a [US News & World Report](https://wtop.com/news/2018/10/can-you-buy-a-money-order-with-a-credit-card/) piece that was published by WTOP. I talked about what it means to get a cash advance from your credit card.
