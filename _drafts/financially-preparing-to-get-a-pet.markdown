As you may have seen in past posts or on social media, my husband and I are in the process of getting a puppy! Dan has desperately wanted a dog for as long as I've known him. I came to the desire more gradually. I grew up with cats and wasn't around dogs very often, unless I was at one of my cousins' houses. I also had a few negative experiences with big dogs when I was younger (and very small), so I've always been a big hesitant when it comes to dogs. Dan wore me down over the years with his exuberance about corgis and now I want one too! 

A lot of the conversation around getting a dog has been related to money (can you believe it?). Since we were initially planning to buy a corgi from a breeder, we knew that it was going to be a decent financial investment. We also learned that dog owners typically spend around $1,600 on their dog in the first year of owning them. I wanted to overestimate how much we thought we would spend and save it up ahead of time.

We also had a few changes to make to our house before we felt comfortable getting a dog. The fence in our backyard was rotting and falling over in several places. There was no way we'd feel good putting a puppy back there without it escaping. So we decided to replace the fence before we got the dog. As you can imagine, this is quite the additional expense. 

Your situation might be very different from ours, but there are still many questions you should answer for yourself before you go to a rescue and pick out a puppy. 

## Make Sure You Can Afford One

## Decide If You Want to Buy or Adopt

## Save Up the First Year of Expenses

## Fund an Emergency Savings Account

## Decide If You Need Pet Insurance
