How I Earned Money This Week

## How I Spent Money This Week

* On Sunday, I met up with my friend Nina for tea and some shopping. I had a coupon for a free drink at Bakers and Baristas, so I only spent $3.50 on my chocolate croissant. Then we went to LOFT, where I spent $60 on a blouse and a cardigan. Each item was originally $50, so I got a great discount. I've been slowly trying to create a wardrobe that I'm happy and confident in, so I'm glad that I was able to find two pieces that I like!
