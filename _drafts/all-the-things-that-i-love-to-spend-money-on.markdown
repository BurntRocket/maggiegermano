Almost two weeks ago now, I attended my fourth [FinCon](https://finconexpo.com/). It's an annual conference where financial professionals and brands come together to learn from each other and make relationships. I first attended when I was merely six months into being a financial coach, and this year is the first time that I felt like I actually knew a lot of people and could help educate others. In fact, I was on a panel about remaining authentic while building a financial coaching business. Needless to say, it was a whirlwind four days and I was pretty exhausted (in a good way) afterwards. One of my biggest takeaways, though, was a keynote speech that I didn't think I would actually enjoy.
