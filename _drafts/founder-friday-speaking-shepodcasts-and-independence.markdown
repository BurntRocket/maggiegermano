Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my monthly clients paid their fee.

* The September Money Circle meetup was on Wednesday.

* Dan got his bi-weekly paycheck today.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Tuesday, Dan and I booked our flights to Peru for November! Flights came out to be about $500 each round-trip, but we'll be applying points from our Capital One Venture card to cover the amount.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I re-published an old [ForbesWomen](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/cultural-background-affects-americans-ability-to-reach-financial-goals/) post about how cultural background can influence the financial goals that we're able to reach.

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I’ve launched the virtual **[Money Circle membership group](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)**, called the Inner Circle! With this program, people who don’t live in DC are now able to be more connected to me and Money Circle. And those who already attend in person can get even more support! Accessibility is incredibly important to me, so depending on your needs and your budget, there are three different tiers for you to choose from.
