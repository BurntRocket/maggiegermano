One of the most popular questions I get from clients and readers is this: how should we combine finances after we get married? And to be honest, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to that question. But it's an important question to answer for yourself and your spouse. 

## Talk, Talk, Talk

I hope you had the money talk before you got married, but if not, you must do it now. Money touches every area of our lives, so it's imperative to talk about it with our partners. Talk about how your parents dealt with money while you were growing up. Talk about any money mistakes you've made it the past. Talk about your money habits and if and when you go overboard with your spending. 

## Get Transparent

If you're going to be sharing your life, you should be transparent about what that life includes. That means getting really honest about

## Set Joint Goals

Money is much easier to talk about when you frame it around your goals. It reminds you why you're sticking to a budget, which makes it more motivating, and sometimes easier. Setting joint goals is even more important, so that you both know what you're working towards. It also will allow you to act as a team when it comes to your money, because ... 

## Decide If/How to Combine Accounts

Every couple handles money differently. Gone are the days when the husband earned the money and handled all the financial decisions. Gone are the days when women weren't even allowed to have their own bank accounts. Now, as marriages look different than they used to, and women are becoming the main breadwinners, there are more options for handling money.

For Dan and me, we each have our own checking and savings accounts, but we also have joint accounts. Most of our expenses and spending come out of our joint accounts, but we also have our own money to use as we please. 

## Assign the Money Point Person

Who is going to be the one to pay the bills? Whose name is going to be on the accounts? Sometimes, there is an obvious person who is more financially inclined or organized. Or perhaps, one of you hates managing money less than the other. 

## Meet With a Financial Expert

Dan and I recently met with a friend of mine who is a financial planner. Yes, I'm a financial coach but I'm not an investment expert, nor do I know much about things like life insurance. Now that we're getting married, I wanted to make sure we're on the right track financially. This is especially true since I'm not putting as much away for retirement this year, as I've taken a big pay cut by quitting my day job. I wanted to make sure I'd still be secure in the future while taking a break for a year or two. We got great advice for retirement savings, and learned a lot about life insurance. I feel a lot more confident and secure about our

## Have Regular Money Dates

Just like you can't set and forget a budget, you can't set and forget joint financial goals. You have to check in and make sure things are still on track, and see if there are any tweaks that need to be made.
