Let's try this again! This event is the meetup rescheduled from September. It's probably too late to plan for this year's holidays, but if you come, you'll be completely prepared for next year!

It's important to plan for holiday spending months in advance. Otherwise, you’ll get to December and have no money set aside for travel and gifts. The holidays are expensive, stressful times. There’s a lot of planning and spending that might not fit into your budget. But there are ways to set yourself up for success. Join us for Money Circle to learn how you can plan ahead and reduce (or even eliminate) the financial stress that comes up around the holidays.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.

Refunds: Money Circle is a limited seating event. If you have to cancel for any reason within 24 hours, your ticket is non-refundable. However, feel free to gift it or sell it to a friend! Just be sure to let me know of the exchange at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com).
