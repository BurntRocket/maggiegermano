I've written [in the past](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-are-your-options-for-debt-consolidation/) about using a balance transfer in order to consolidate your debt or lower your interest rates. It is a method that I often hear about from my friends and clients. Basically, you transfer the balance of one credit card to another credit card. This is usually done to take advantage of low or no interest offers. Sounds like a great deal, right? It can be! But it's important to know both the pros *and* cons of this approach before you dive in. 

**Pros:**

* No interest

* More time to pay off your debt

**Cons:**

* Origination fee

* Time limit

* More credit
