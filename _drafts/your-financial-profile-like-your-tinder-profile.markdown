Have you ever worried about what a potential romantic partner might think about your financial standing? Have financial issues ever caused issues between you and your romantic partner? If you answered "yes" to either of those questions, you're not alone! In fact, money is a leading cause of relationship strife, often being cited as a reason for [divorce](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/featured/money-causes-21-percent-divorces925885150/). Plus, according to findings by [Finder.com](https://www.finder.com/unacceptable-partner-debt), 72 percent of Americans said they would reconsider a romantic relationship because of the other person's debt.

However, according to Experian's recent consumer survey, only 31 percent of people believe that their financial profile will show them in a good light. Furthermore, 51 percent of people don't think they know enough about their own financial profile. In contrast, more than half of Experian's respondents feel as though their social media and online dating profiles show them in a positive light. This is in large part due to how highly curated online profiles are.

## Why Does Your Financial Profile Matter?

I mentioned that a large majority of people would have second thoughts about entering into a relationship with someone who has debt. I don't necessarily agree with that sentiment, but it's something to consider if you're looking for a longterm relationship. However, there are other reasons why this should be important to you that go beyond romantic love.

1. **Credit worthiness:** Your financial history will determine whether or not a lender wants to front money to you. This applies to credit card companies, mortgage lenders, personal and student loan providers, car companies, and more. If your credit history looks bad, these lenders can decide not to give you a loan at all, which can limit what you're able to do with your future.

2. **Interest rates:** If you do get approved for a loan, the interest rates on that loan will vary depending on your credit history and credit score. 

3. Origination fees:

## How Can You Curate It More Like Your Online Profiles?

**Make It a Priority**

Recognize that your financial standing matters for your own stability and security. 

**Pay Attention To It**

You need to pay attention to your financial profile in order to be able to fix it at all. You can't fix what you don't know is broken! 

**Talk About It**

Check credit score monthly, check credit report 3x a year

I got an email a couple months ago from Experian about their new "[Experian Financial Profile](https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/financial-profile.html)".

Yes, there is an actual financial profile being offered by Experian, but even if you don't sign up for that, you should still care about your financial story.
