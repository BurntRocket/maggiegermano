Happy Friday, y’all!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* Lots of money coming in this week! One of my retainer clients paid their monthly fee, two of my ongoing coaching clients paid their fees, and a new client paid for her first month of coaching!

* We also have had Airbnb guests all week. May has been a very busy month for our rental. 

* Dan's bi-weekly paycheck came in today. 

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* We were in Virginia Beach visiting friends over the weekend. We mostly ate at their house, but after they treated us to pizza on Saturday, we bought a bunch of groceries for a cookout on Sunday. We also got some snacks and gas for the drive home. 

* Dan made a pretty substantial grocery run on Monday that left us with almost more food than we could eat this week.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about [life insurance](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/Why-Women-Should-Get-Life-Insurance/) and why it's so important for women to have it, especially if they have people depending on them.

## **What I’m Up To**

* The [June Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-visualizing-your-money-goals-tickets-62153044429) is up and available for registration! At this event, we’ll be visualizing our money goals so that they’re more motivating and easier to track. See you there?

* I’ve been hinting at starting a podcast for a while now. But in order to make sure the podcast is interesting and helpful for YOU, I want to make sure I’m answering your questions. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit any and all money questions that you have!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* My friend Nina is getting married tomorrow! I can't wait to celebrate her and her fiance and dance the night away.

* I'm going to Cape May next week! My sisters, two cousins, and I are taking a girls trip to the beach for the first time. It'll be so nice to relax and have quality time with my fam. 

## **What I’m Reading**

I read all of *[Bird Box](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18498558-bird-box)* by Josh Malerman this week. It was even scarier than the movie and I ended up having apocalyptic dreams every night. I also started *[The Interestings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15815333-the-interestings)* by Meg Wolitzer and am still working my way through *[Ghosts in the Schoolyard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38923643-ghosts-in-the-schoolyard?from_search=true)* by Eve L. Ewing.
