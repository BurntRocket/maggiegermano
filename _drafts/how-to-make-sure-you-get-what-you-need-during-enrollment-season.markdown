**Pre-S:** *Open enrollment season has begun! If you are going to enroll in marketplace insurance, you have from November 1 until December 15 to do so. Donâ€™t wait! Start your research and get yourself enrolled.*

It's not enough to just enroll in health insurance. You also need to make sure that you're getting the healthcare coverage that you *need*. Because if you have health insurance, but it doesn't cover what you need it to, how useful is it really? This might take a little extra research and a little more legwork, but it will be worth it once you know you get what you need. Here's how to make that happen.

## Get Clear On Your Needs

The most important part of choosing a health insurance plan is to make sure you're getting the coverage you actually need. So the first step is to understand your own needs and those of your family. 

* Do you have medications that you need coverage? 

* Do you need access to mental health services?

* Are there specialists that you need to see? 

* Do you plan to have a baby? 

* Are there other necessary or foreseeable procedures coming down the pike? 

## Look At The Coverage

Look very closely at what is covered and what isn't covered under the plans available to you. 

## Look At The Premium Costs

Understand how much the monthly premium is going to be. Can you afford it? Is the coverage so robust that the premium is worth it? 

## Look At The Deductibles

The monthly premium isn't the only thing that matters when you are choosing a healthcare plan. You want to fully understand your deductible, as well. A deductible is the amount paid out of pocket by you before your insurance provider will pay any expenses. For example, a deductible might be $1,000. That means you have to pay $1,000 worth of medical expenses before your health insurance coverage kicks in. (That doesn't apply to preventative care, which is fully covered from the start.) Sometimes

Make sure that you can afford the deductible and that it's not so high that you'll avoid getting the healthcare that you need. 

## Look At The Co-Pays

## Take Advantage of FSAs or HSAs

A great way to make sure that you can afford your co-pays and deductibles is to take advantage of an FSA or and HSA. There is a difference between the two, though.

* FSA: Also known as a flexible spending account, xx This money gets deducted from your paycheck pre-tax and is put on a card or into an account, which you can use to pay for things like co-pays, medical costs that aren't covered, etc. If you don't use the available balance by the end of the year, you will lose the money.

* HSA: Also known as a health savings account, which is available to people who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan. If you don't use the available balance by the end of the year, it will roll over from year to year. 

## Ask The Experts

There is so much support and so many resources out there that you should be taking advantage of. If you get health insurance through your employer, there are people at your company whose job it is to answer your questions. Go to them to walk you through your options so that you feel comfortable that you're making the right decision. If you need to buy private insurance on your own, or purchase through the marketplace, there are still lots of resources at your disposal. [Healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) has a whole ["Get Answers"](https://www.healthcare.gov/get-answers/) page and you can talk to people and ask questions on the phone. [Kaiser](https://www.kff.org/understanding-health-insurance/) also has lots of resources, available in more than one language.

## Be Wary of Junk Plans

As was discussed at length in episode 13 of the Money Circle podcast, junk plans are short-term duration plans. They have recently been allowed to be included in the healthcare marketplace, though they do not actually provide good coverage.
