Happy Friday! I’m back from my honeymoon and ready to start reporting back about my week again. Do you find these weekly reviews useful or interesting? Let me know in the comments!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We had three different Airbnb guests stay with us this week and through the weekend.

* Money Circle was this week, and the Eventbrite payout is in process.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I hadn't gotten a haircut since July, so it was definitely time for one. I had grown my hair out a bit for the wedding, and was missing my short hair. So I went to [Bubbles Salon](http://www.bubblessalons.com/) near Union Station for a cut. I'm not super thrilled with how it turned out, so I might need a touch up after Christmas. Do you have a favorite hair stylist in DC or Maryland? I'm on the hunt for a new one that I can trust!

* Last night, I went to a holiday happy hour for the women's entrepreneur group that I'm in. (It's called [Feminist Founder](https://www.feministfounder.com/), and if you're a self-employed lady in the DC-area, you should join!) I got a beer, pot stickers, and bacon wrapped dates (yus). 

## **What I’m Writing**

My latest piece on [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2018/12/11/investors-think-they-are-fair-but-minority-owned-businesses-are-left-out/) is up! This week, I wrote about a new report that shows the discrepancy between how investors *think* they are making funding decisions and what is *really* happening. Spoiler: women and minority-owned businesses get the short end of the stick.

## **What I’m Up To**

* The December Money Circle meetup was this week! We got really worked up talking about the stresses and expectations around holiday gift-giving.
