This month is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. As I mentioned [last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/3-financial-hurdles-that-keep-women-in-abusive-relationships/), 1 in 4 women will experience intimate partner violence in their lives. That's a large segment of our population. And the truth is, when physical and emotional violence are already involved, they typically aren't the only tool of abuse that are being used. In fact, financial abuse is also present in 98 percent of abusive relationships.

Financial abuse is when money is being used as a tool of control or abuse. It can range from subtle to overt, and that's why it can be difficult to identify, even if it's happening to you. If you recognize some of the behaviors below, you might be experiencing financial abuse.

One of the most damaging forms of financial abuse is when an abuser runs up debt in their victim's name. Even if you're married to someone, the only person truly responsible for debt is the one whose name is on it. In many abusive relationships, the abuser will either take out debt in their victim's name and run up the debt, or they will use their victim's existing accounts and run up their debt.

As I've written about in the past, our credit score and credit history can have a big impact on what kinds of opportunities we might have in the future. They determine whether we can get a student loan, a mortgage, a car loan, a credit card, an apartment... even a job. So it goes without saying that having a negative credit history can hurt our futures in a big way. That is why damaging a victim's credit is an easy way for an abuser to exert control and harm over their victim. This can look like taking out debt in the victim's name and then defaulting on that debt. It can look like not making payments on bills that are in the victim's name.

## Making Large Purchases Without Consulting You

Of course, every couple is different. You don't necessarily have to run every purchase by your partner, but it is often a good idea to have some ground rules on making big purchases. This is so that if your finances are merged and you have joint financial goals, you'll be able to

## Monitoring Your Spending

Just like the above example, every couple is different. In my own marriage, I manage the finances, which are mostly merged, so I typically can see all of my husbands transactions. This is essential for me so that I can make sure we're staying on budget and can afford to pay our bills. In a financial abuse situation, the abuser would be monitoring spending to the point of control. In this scenario, the victim would be afraid to spend money on anything in case they will get in trouble.

## Controlling How Money is Spent

Similar to the above example, some abusers not only monitor spending, but completely control how all money can be spent. 

There are certainly more examples for how financial abuse is
