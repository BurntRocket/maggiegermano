Kelsey is a birth, postpartum, and postoperative doula, and the Founder of Rainbow Doula DC, a queer-focused doula collective in the DC area. She focuses on a culture of respect for all birthing people, and is hoping to shift the culture around birth to be more inclusive of non-binary and trans folx. She is passionate about an approach that is trauma-informed and rooted in consent-based care. Before coming to doula work, Kelsey worked in international relations and reproductive health advocacy.
