## Make the change you deserve
One of the most important things in life is the sense of community; feeling like you’re not alone in life. This is especially true when it comes to issues that bring us shame and confusion.
We live in a society where money is an unspoken taboo. We aren’t supposed to ask people how much money we earn, and women especially have a hard time knowing and asking for what they are worth. It’s more important than ever to band together and put it all on the table.
