Happy Friday! I hope you’ve been staying warm now that’s it’s for real winter. Here’s what I was up to this week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had two different Airbnb guests stay with us this week.

* One of my new clients paid for her first month of coaching.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Ever since Trader Joe's discontinued my favorite herbal tea (RIP TJ's ginger peach white tea), I have been searching for a new favorite tea to drink in the evenings. I found a ginger peach white tea from The Republic of Tea, so I bought some to try it out. Hopefully it's just as good! If you have a favorite (non-chamomile) evening tea, please share!

* Dan and I have decided to try our hand at making candles. We ordered a starter kit this week and are going to give it a shot today!

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about [how to talk to loved ones](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-talk-to-loved-ones-if-you-dont-want-to-receive-gifts/) if you no longer want to receive gifts at the holidays. It's not necessarily an easy conversation, but one that is important to have if you want to set that boundary.

## **What I’m Up To**

* I've written before that I want to do more speaking engagements as part of my business. It's a great way to reach more people at a more accessible price point. This past Tuesday, I went to an Innovation Women event to learn more about getting speaking gigs, and also to have a video taken of me describing the work that I do.
