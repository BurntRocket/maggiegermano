February is [Black History Month](https://www.africanamericanhistorymonth.gov/) in the United States. Of course, as a nation, we should be celebrating the history and contributions of Black Americans everyday. But unfortunately, people of color are still viewed as a minority interest group in our society, so we have to create specific dates to center them.

This week, I want to focus on the long-lasting economic effects of racism. Money touches every part of our lives. We need it in order to survive. We need it in order to thrive. Whether or not we have it affects what we have access to. It affects our health and the health of our families.  Similarly, racism affects every part of life. Below is just a few ways that money and racism intersect, and how that affects people throughout their lives.

## College Admissions

I'm sure you've heard of affirmative action, which is the policy of promoting the education and employment of members of groups that have previously suffered from discrimination. A lot of the conversation around affirmative action makes it sound like it's a discriminatory process that favors people specifically for the color of their skin. The truth is, white people (and white men, especially) have always been favored due to the color of their skin. That is why white people hold more of the wealth, more positions of power, more seats in Congress, etc. 

Historically, racism has prevented people of color from being admitted to college, both explicitly, and because tuition is prohibitively expensive. Additionally, even if someone is able to attend college, racism still has effects on campus. These issues prevent people of color from getting the education that they desire or require in order to enter the career field of their choice. This has a domino effect through communities and families as folks are not able to 

## Redlining

Have you ever wondered why poor neighborhoods are disproportionately black?

*If you feel you have been a victim of redlining and want to file a Fair Housing Complaint, you can do so online for free at [portal.hud.gov](https://www.hud.gov/).)*

## Gerrymandering

Have you ever looked at a map of your voting district and the ones surrounding you and feel completely perplexed? You're not alone. Many districts around the United States are drawn in a way that makes no sense and often ends up disenfranchising the folks living in the districts. This practice is called gerrymandering,

How does gerrymandering have an economic effect? It continues the disenfranchisement of people of color by by weakening their vote.

## Welfare

Welfare is a government program which provides financial aid to individuals or groups who are unable to support themselves. These programs are funded by taxes and allow people to deal with financial stress during hard times. The six major welfare programs in the United States are [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tanf/about) (TANF), [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/), [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap) (SNAP), [Supplemental Security Income](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/), [Earned Income Tax Credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit), and [Housing Assistance](https://www.hud.gov/topics/rental_assistance). These programs provide support for basic needs, like food, healthcare, and housing, and were created to be a safety net for folks who either fall under hard times or are physically or mentally unable to care for themselves.

Where does racism come into play here? There is a false belief that people of color are the only ones using these programs. There is also a false belief that those people are taking advantage of the programs when they don't need them. Have you ever heard of the racist term "welfare queen"? Language like that perpetuates the belief that the people who need these programs are just lazy or are defrauding the system. That is obviously not the case! Welfare programs are based on a family's income. To qualify, their income must be below an income based on the federal poverty level. These beliefs make it so that lawmakers often feel justified in cutting funding for these incredibly important and necessary programs. 

**Here's the truth about welfare: **

* Government welfare programs are cited for the decline of the poverty rate from 25 percent in 1967 to 14 percent in 2016.

* Only 23 percent of families living in poverty receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families cash assistance in the United States.

* Nearly 24 percent of Americans participated in the Medicaid managed care program in 2016.

* On average 21 percent of Americans participate in at least one government assistance program.

* 43 percent of Medicaid recipients were white, 18 percent were African American and 30 percent were Hispanic in 2016.

As you can see, welfare helps many of us at any given time in our lives. 

## The Prison Industrial Complex

The Prison Industrial Complex is a term that [describes](http://criticalresistance.org/about/not-so-common-language/) "the overlapping interests of government and industry that use surveillance, policing and imprisonment as solutions to economic, social and political problems".

## The Racial Wage Gap

I've written a lot about the gender wage gap, but there is also a racial wage gap. And of course, half of people of color are also women, so there is a double wage gap for them.

## Racism in Medicine

Access to affordable, effective healthcare is a human right.

Another way this plays out is during pregnancy and childbirth. In Washington, DC, the maternal maternity rate for black women is four times as high as it is for white women. In the same city! It's gotten to crisis levels

If you live in DC, contact your [councilperson](https://dccouncil.us/councilmembers/) today and urge them to vote for the [Certified Professional Midwife Act](https://twitter.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=599e1a5beef7a95f302010721&id=197c748929&e=22b115a14f), which has the support of reproductive justice advocates and birthworkers in the community, like the providers at [Mamatoto Village](https://www.mamatotovillage.org/), and will help bridge the gap in care for black women in maternal care deserts by establishing training and oversight of culturally competent professionals who can legally assist in births outside of a hospital setting.
