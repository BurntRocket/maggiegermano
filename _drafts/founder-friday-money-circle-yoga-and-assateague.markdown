Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Again, we're trying to keep our spending down this month, since we have a lot of big expenses coming up in the next few months. However, Dan pulled money from his savings account to buy himself a pottery wheel from someone near Ocean City. It's his first step towards creating a home pottery studio eventually.

* Since we were so close to Ocean City, we decided to drive a little bit further and visit Assateague Island for the first time. It was so beautiful there! It was cool seeing the ponies hanging around the marshes and walking down the street. We paid $20 to get into the national park area of the island. We also bought lunch and some snacks for the long drive home. Bruno had a great time running around on the beach. We definitely plan to go back and spend more than just a couple of hours there.

* On Wednesday, I bought myself from snacks from Target while I was downtown all day for meetings. I also bought snacks for the Money Circle meetup that was held that night.
