Money is a tricky subject. It touches every single part of our lives, be it our relationships, our careers, our health, and beyond. This can put stress on us beyond just the literal money concerns. But it also carries with it a societal taboo and a healthy dose of shame, which makes it even harder to deal with. Combine these facts and stress is inevitable.

To make things worse, women are more worried about money than men are. According to a study by [Allianz](http://www.allianzusa.com/lovefamilymoney/insights/financial-stress-affects-men-and-women-differently/), 67 percent of women worry about covering their current financial expenses compared to 57 percent of men. It doesn't get much better when it comes to future planning. Eighty-one percent of women stress about planning for their future financial needs compared to 72 percent of men.

## Why is this?

* Roughly 75 percent of Americans donâ€™t have any savings to fall back and many live paycheck to paycheck.

* More than half of all workers admit to feeling financially stressed, costing business an estimated $250 billion a year in lost productivity and absenteeism, according to a [Mercer](https://www.mercer.com/newsroom/financial-stress-could-cost-us-employers-up-to-250-billion-in-lost-wages-annually-finds-new-mercer-survey.html) study.

* Women make up 57 percent of the workforce in the United States, but they are paid a median salary that is 81 percent of what their male colleagues are paid. 

* Women have less household debt than their male counterparts, but only 42 percent reported being comfortable with their debt level compared to 56 percent of men.

* Women are less prepared for retirement, saving an average of only $165,200 compared to their male counterparts, who have an average $243,300 saved. However, both men and women expect to retire around the same age.

* Eighty-one percent of women stress about planning for their future financial needs compared to 72 percent of men.

## So what does all this stress lead to?

**Unhealthy Behaviors**

We all have some unhealthy coping behaviors that we gravitate towards when we're overwhelmed by stress. For me, it's eating too much candy and watching lots of tv. In moderation, these things feel great, but with too much, I feel like crap and I regret it.

Other unhealthy behaviors can be excess drinking, drug use, overeating, overspending, and more. These behaviors can negatively impact our physical and mental health, which then makes us more stressed.

Lack of Self Care

When people are stressed, we tend to abandon the things that make us feel better. This can be healthy eating, exercising, or getting enough rest. 

**Depression and Low Self Esteem**

Money issues, but debt in particular, can impact your mental health and self esteem. Melanie Lockert, founder of [Dear Debt](http://deardebt.com/), has written about this a lot. 

**Insomnia**

There's a reason the saying "losing sleep" exists. 

**Illness**

Stress can cause or exacerbate many different illnesses.

**Relationship Troubles**

Money is one of the top causes of relationship discord. This can happen both in romantic and platonic relationships, depending on the situation.  

As you probably could guess, these problems can lead to more financial trouble! It can become a vicious cycle: financial problems > stress > health and relationship troubles \+ negative coping behaviors > financial problems > repeat.
