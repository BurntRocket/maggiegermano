When you hear people talk about investing, you probably think about the stock market and your retirement account. But do you also think about other ways that you can invest in yourself? This could be furthering your education, hiring a coach or therapist, starting a business... the list is endless! And these types of investment are just as important as saving for retirement, but don't always seem that way. So here are the times I think you should invest in yourself and how to make it happen.

## When to Invest in Yourself

**You're Feeling Lost**

Have you ever heard of throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks? Sometimes you might have to do that in your life if you're feeling lost or unclear. 

Three years ago, I was feeling aimless, depressed, and scared. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I realized I could not continue with my status quo, so I looked around... So I signed up for Bossed Up Bootcamp and eventually 

**You Can't Do It On Your Own**

**You Want To**

Sometimes wanting to do something important for yourself is reason enough to do it.

## Why to Invest in Yourself

**You Deserve It**

**You Have to In Order to Advance**

Say you wake up one day and realize that your dream is to become a nurse and dedicate your life to helping people. You can't just apply to be a nurse somewhere, you have to go to nursing school.

There are many other scenarios where additional schooling or certifications are needed in order to advance in your career and/or income. These are times when it's almost essential to make an investment in yourself.

**Your Happiness Matters**

**It's Worth It In the Long Run**

It can be hard to spend money and time on something up front, especially if the investment is larger than you typically spend. However, sometimes investments will save or earn you money in the long run.

For example, investing in a service like financial coaching can end up saving you money in the future. Yes, you're paying money up front that might seem like a lot. But through this service, you're improving your relationship with money, you're learning how to create and stick to a budget, you're coming up with a plan to pay down your debt or build up savings, you're setting yourself up for financial success in the future. Results like these can be invaluable.

## How to Invest in Yourself

**Ask Your Employer**

It's easy to forget this, but many employers include professional development in their organizational budget. It's a great way to help employees build their skills and advance in their career. It's also a great way to keep employees happy. If you're already employed, ask your boss or HR department if they pay for professional development. If you're applying or interviewing for jobs, make that one of your important questions.

My previous employer paid for me to attend conferences and trainings like Bossed Up Bootcamp. I wasn't sure if they would go for it, but I made my case, and they said yes! And remember, the worst that can happen is they say no. But the best that can happen is you get experiences that you might never have gotten otherwise.

**Save Up**

One of my clients has created a "personal and professional development fund". It's a savings account that is specifically for things that will advance her on a personal and professional level. For her, this includes coaching training, painting classes, and other things that bring her joy and fulfillment.

Another client started a savings account for grad school. She knows she won't be able to save up the full amount of tuition by the time she goes, but the amount she'll save will make her life a lot easier once it's time.

So open up a savings account just for investing in yourself. Automate a set amount to go into it every month.

**Cut Back on Spending**

You'd be surprised at what you can afford when you scrutinize your spending. One of my former clients wasn't sure if she could afford financial coaching. After 3 months of working together, she realized she was able to live life normally, without missing my fee. Now that we're no longer working together, she's decided to put that money into savings every month, since she was able to live without it every month.

So put yourself on a tight budget and cut back on the things that you don't need or truly want. This might bring up feelings of scarcity in you, but you should keep your eye on the big picture. You're making a short-term sacrifice now so that you'll have long-term gain later.

As my friend and life and career coach, [Noelle Janka](http://www.noellejanka.com/), said: "It's hard to have joy in discipline if you don't know what it's for." Get clear on why you're making this sacrifice now, so that you're investing in yourself, and improving your life later. Finding your why and keeping it in the forefront of your mind will make this process so much easier. And the reward will be so much sweeter!

**Take Out a Loan**

This wouldn't always be a recommended option for investing in yourself. However, if you're going back to school, buying property, or starting a business, it might make sense to take out a loan. This can be scary
