This month, we've talked about what [benefits you should negotiate](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/non-salary-perks-you-should-ask-for/) and how much [money you should ask for](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-pick-a-salary-number-that-works-for-you/). Those are super important things in terms of your career. But what about whether or not a company is actually the right fit for you? We might not focus on that particular  issue, but your work environment is also key in order for you to be happy.

## Culture

Culture is the character and personality of your organization. It's the sum of its values, traditions, beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes. So, what kind of workplace do you want to be in? What environment makes you feel the most at home? Are there any cultural deal breakers? These are absolutely questions you should be asking yourself when looking for a new job. Pay attention to how people in the office are dressed and how they interact with each other. Ask around about the values and attitudes of the organization. Do they align with the type of space you want to be in? 

## Work/Life Balance

Work/life balance is the concept of having balanced prioritization between your career and the rest of your life. This can ensure that your relationships thrive, your health doesn't suffer, and you generally are a well-balanced person. Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, many workplaces don't encourage balance. In fact, some places can discourage even taking a lunch break. There can be perceived competition to work the "hardest", which often looks like working the longest. If it's important to you to be with your loved ones uninterrupted after 6pm, find out about the expectations in the office. This also applies to things like vacation and sick days. I personally think we all need to protect our free time intensely. 

## Commute

I don't know about you, but my commute to work has a huge impact on my mental health. I know for a fact that I could never drive long distances in traffic everyday. I often watch other people in their cars, yelling and honking. I don't want to spend hours of my day that way. So how about you? What are you able to deal with? Would a long commute be worth it for your dream job? Perhaps living in a more affordable place that is far away from your office is necessary for you. You should figure out what you're willing to sacrifice, and go from there.
