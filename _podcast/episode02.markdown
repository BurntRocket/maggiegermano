## Episode Summary

This week, Maggie is answering a couple of listener questions about savings accounts. She talks about how to use online banks to maximize your savings and make your money work for you.

## Episode Notes

The things you want to consider when choosing an online bank:

* **Interest rates** - make sure they are offering high-yield savings accounts

* **Fees** - make sure you aren’t paying any monthly maintenance fees

* **Minimum balance requirements** - make sure that the bank doesn’t require you to either deposit or maintain a certain balance

* **Mobile accessibility** - make sure the bank has a good online portal that allows you to easily access your money

* **ATM fee reimbursement** - since online banks are only online, that means that they typically don’t have any of their own ATMs for you to withdraw money from. Make sure that they offer monthly reimbursement for any ATM fees you’ve paid when withdrawing money.

There are lots of online banks out there these days. Here are just a few to start with:

* Ally Bank

* Synchrony Bank

* Barclays

* American Express
