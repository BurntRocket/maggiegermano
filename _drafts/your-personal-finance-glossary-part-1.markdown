April is Financial Literacy Month. It’s okay if you forgot, because I almost did too! The COVID-19 crisis has thrown us all for a loop. But I still want to help you move forward with your financial goals and get your money in order, especially during a global pandemic. That’s why, this month, I’ll be going back to my somewhat normal content, starting with a financial glossary.

One of the things that can be most frustrating is seeing lots of terms and words out there that you think might apply to you, but that you don’t actually understand. And it's okay to not understand - why would you know something if you never learned it? That's why I'm here! I polled my friends, family, and followers for financial terms that they want to understand better. Here's what we came up with:

## 401K

xx

## 503B

xx

## **Roth IRA**

xx

## **SEP IRA**

xx

## **Traditional IRA**

xx

## **Universal Default**

This was actually a term I'd never personally heard before, but it was submitted by a friend of mine. 

## Escrow

xx

## **Capital Gains**

specifically for homeowners

## **Recession**

xx

## **Depression**

xx

## **Stock Options**

how are they different from stocks?

## **Annuities**

xx

## **CD**

CD is short for certificate of deposit. 

## **APR**

xx

## **Amortization**

xx

## **Closing Costs**

Closing costs is a term that you will hear if you are in the process of buying a home. But that doesn't mean that you know what it means or what is will actually cost you. Basically, closing costs are the fees that you will owe, as a buyer, once you officially close on your new home. This usually adds up to 2-5 percent of the cost of the home. According to [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-learning/closing-costs/), the average buyer pays $3,700 in closing costs. This encompasses things like:

* Appraisal

* Title attorney fee

* Credit report

* Escrow deposit for property taxes and mortgage insurance

* Home inspection

* Homeowner's insurance

* Underwriting fee

* Title insurance

* And plenty more!

Basically, these costs are unavoidable when you're buying a home, but it's easy to forget 

## **Liquid Savings**

This term came up when I was texting with my sisters and two of my cousins. My one cousin was asking if she should be more aggressive while paying down her student loans and I asked her how much liquid savings she has. She said, "maybe that's a term you should add to your glossary", because she wasn't sure what it meant. 

Liquid savings is any money in a savings account that you have immediate access to. Any money in the stock market or even in a CD is not considered liquid. And that is due to a few things:

* The stock market is volatile, so your balance is likely to fluctuate over time. That means that you won't always have the same amount of money available to you.

* It can take several days to get money out of your stock market accounts and into your bank account.

* If you withdraw money from a CD before the term is over, you will get penalized with fees.

Liquid savings is money that you would keep in a savings account in a bank, preferably one with a high-yield interest rate and no monthly fees. This is the type of account that you should keep your emergency fund in. Any money that you rely on or will need at a moment's notice should be kept here.

Are there other financial words or terms that you wish you understood better? Send them to me and I’ll include them in my next glossary post! Share in the comments or send me an email at hello (at) maggiegermano (dot) com.
