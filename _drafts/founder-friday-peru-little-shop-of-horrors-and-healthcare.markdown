Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* A one-time session client paid for their session this week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* We are freshly back home after being in Peru for 10 days. On Sunday, we paid to get to the airport in Lima, bought some snacks in the airport, paid for our parking at Dulles Airport, and bought McDonald's on the drive home.

* On Monday, I did a simple grocery run at Whole Foods so that we'd have enough food for healthy, easy meals this week.

* I went downtown on Wednesday for some meetings and for Money Circle. I had to add money to my metro card and I bought some tea, a couple glasses of wine, and some snacks for the Money Circle attendees.

* A few months ago, we received a speeding ticket in the mail (it was Dan driving, not me!). It was a $200 ticket, which isn't something we wanted to pay. We contested the ticket, but we just got another letter from DC saying "too bad, you have to pay up". So I paid that ticket this week in order to avoid any late fees. Luckily, we started saving up for car expenses, so if that $200 ends up not fitting in our monthly budget, we can pull from that account.

* A few months ago, we got a deck built on the back of our house. There's a grant program through our town that will award you up to $1,000 for building new things on your property, like fences and decks. I applied for the grant and found out that the deck company didn't get a permit from the town! I have to go today and pay $50 for the town permit so that we are eligible for the grant. (Moral of the story: don't trust that your contractors are doing what they said they'd do! Double check.)

## **What I’m Writing**

* On the blog, I wrote about how you can make sure that you're getting [exactly what you need](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-make-sure-you-get-what-you-need-during-enrollment-season/) from your health insurance plan.

* Before I left for Peru, I published a piece on my [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2019/11/08/women-hate-open-enrollment-season-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be-that-way/#2f5118f362ee) column. It's all about how stressful we find open enrollment season, and how we can make it a little bit easier for ourselves.

## **What I’m Saying**

* This week, I switched away from the healthcare conversation and talked about how you can [financially prepare to get a pet](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/preparing-for-pet-costs/). 

* Fill out [this questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform) to submit your own money questions for the podcast. Nothing is too big or too small! If you or someone you know would make a great guest, [submit your name](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScz6LcFar3rRZ64vdkdq--A51Ei7pwzL4e8C514tjaeokSMhA/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

## **What I’m Up To**

I’ve created a virtual [Money Circle membership program](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)! If you are not located in the DC area, or if you just want more connection through Money Circle, this program is for you. There are 3 tiers that offer different options at different price points. There is a group coaching component and even a level that lets you check in with me every month. [Sign up today!](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)

## **What I’m Excited About**

* We're going to a show tonight! For our first wedding anniversary, Dan bought us tickets to see [Little Shop of Horrors](https://www.constellationtheatre.org/little-shop-horrors) at Constellation Theater in downtown DC. We're still doing a "low spend" month, so we're going to get an affordable dinner beforehand and then head to the show.

* We're hosting Thanksgiving at our house for the first time ever! We always celebrate Thanksgiving with Dan's family and this year, his sister has limited days off, so it's easier for us to host at our house. Luckily, Dan is the cook, so I feel more excited than stressed about hosting. If you have any recipes that you love or recommendations for hosting during a holiday, I'd love to hear them!

* Yes, we literally just got back from Peru, but we are heading off to Japan in less than two months. If you've been to Japan and have tips or must-sees, let me know!

## **What I’m Reading**

I'm reading a couple books right now. Last night, I started *[The Witches Are Coming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38362811-the-witches-are-coming)* by Lindy West, who is one of my favorite feminists. If you haven't read her first book, *[Shrill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill)*, you must. I'm also reading *[A Tale for the Time Being](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15811545-a-tale-for-the-time-being?from_search=true&qid=Px41rJFGTq&rank=1)* by Ruth Ozeki.
