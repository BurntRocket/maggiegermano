It's mid-June, which means that we're in full swing for summertime! Although summer is never as fun as it was when we were in school and had the summers off, it's still a time that encourages us to spend more time with friends and more time outside. It's also a time of year that inspires us to spend more money, since we're being more social and often traveling more. 

It often seems like you either have to be a hermit during the summer to stay on budget or just blow the whole thing and go off track for months. But I don't think it has to be an either/or situation. There are ways to plan ahead in the winter and spring so that you're financially ready for summer. Do these things so you can feel like you're "splurging" all summer!
