## How I Earned Money This Week

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I spent Sunday and Monday in Frederick, MD. We spent most of our money on a cute bed and breakfast and an all-you-can-eat crab feast. But we did go to a few antique shops to poke around. I bought a couple small gifts, but otherwise the prices were much higher than we anticipated. 

* I spent over $300 on donuts yesterday. Not kidding! We're having donuts instead of cake for our wedding, and we confirmed and paid for our order. I can't wait to see 150 donuts set up at the wedding reception. 

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about [how to stay in control of spending](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-stay-in-control-of-your-wedding-spending/) while you're wedding planning. Things can get out of hand very easily, so read up for my tips!
