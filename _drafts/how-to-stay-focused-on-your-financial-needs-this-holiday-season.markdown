Happy December! We're officially in the swing of holiday season. In the last several days, we've experienced Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and now Cyber Monday. That's a lot of pressure to spend money and buy things. And it's not going to let up as we get closer to the holidays. That's why I want to talk about sticking to your values this season.

> Don't let yourself go into debt or sacrifice your own needs just to show your love through gift-giving.

Starting before Black Friday even came around, we’ve been getting inundated with ads and “deals”. We’re encouraged to shop, shop, shop at every turn. We’re told that in order to show someone we love them, we have to buy them expensive things. And the truth is, this messaging hurts a lot of us. In fact, about a quarter of Americans end up in debt, or deeper in debt, due to holiday spending. That doesn’t sound worth it to me.

Don't let yourself go into debt or sacrifice your own needs just to show your love through gift-giving. Use the tips below to keep your goals and needs in focus this year.

## Get Creative

Our society has definitely fully embraced the idea of giving gifts as our way to celebrate the holidays. And I don't see that going away anytime soon. But the truth is that's not necessarily how you have to do it. However, if you do like giving gifts or if it's a tradition to give gifts in your family, you can get a little bit creative with how you do it. You don't have to go to the store and buy something brand new for someone. You can get crafty and make something. You could make something like a scrapbook for that person to show the history of your relationship with each other or maybe a scrapbook about something that they really love. You could make cookies, you could offer to cook them their favorite meal around the holiday season as a gift for them that could be a nice alternate option for showing your love to someone, especially if it's someone who maybe doesn't want to receive gifts. It also could be just spending time together. My dad often doesn't really want anything in particular for Christmas because he tends to be pretty good at buying things for himself when he wants them. And so he has said, you know, I would love to just go out to lunch with the three daughters and that is good enough for me. Um, so those are just some options and you can get creative. Like I said, it's going to depend on the person. It's gonna depend on you, what you feel comfortable doing, what you're good at. Um, but you know, try to think outside of the box what are ways that you can show your love and enjoy your time with somebody that doesn't put you in debt, that doesn't make you feel like you have to go to the busy mall that maybe stresses you out every day.

Just think a little bit outside the box and get a little bit more creative. You might be surprised by what you'll find.

## Communicate

Communication is so important when it comes to most things, but especially when money is involved. And that's just as important around the holidays. One thing to keep in mind is communicating your own budget limitations. And I've talked about this before, but I think being positive in those conversations is really important. So rather than saying, "Oh my God, I'm so broke, I just can't afford to buy you gifts and like, please don't ask me to get you gifts," it's more like, "I have these very specific financial goals that I'm trying to work towards right now. I'm trying to get my financial life in order. So I want to be more thoughtful and responsible and creative around the holiday season. In lieu of gifts, I'll be baking everybody cookies." That's just one example of how to have that conversation preemptively. 

It's also important to communicate with your loved ones to find out what they actually want and expect around the holidays. I know that there are people out there who receive gifts every year that maybe don't particularly want them. You might be one of those people! Those can be difficult conversations, especially with people who really love to give gifts and that's just something they've always done. But communicating about your needs in that way or your desires in that regard as well as finding out what they really want. Cause like I said, maybe the people you're struggling to get gift forward don't particularly want them.

So asking them, you know, what would mean the most to you this holiday season to receive? And I wouldn't be surprised if a parent was like, I would much rather have you come be home for the holidays, then bring a bunch of gifts. So if it's one or the other, figure out which one they would prefer. But just communicate, have those conversations. Let people know your situation, let them know that you are trying to connect more and that you want to spend more quality time with people over buying gifts for people. And I think you'd be pleasantly surprised at how open people are to that option. Right? Because there's nothing worse than buying a gift for someone because you're supposed to show your love and then presenting them for it because you couldn't actually afford to buy it for them. So try to move away from that resentment and that stress this holiday season and start adopting your own new traditions that help you stick to your goals and align with your values so that you're not getting overwhelmed and being pushed into debt.
