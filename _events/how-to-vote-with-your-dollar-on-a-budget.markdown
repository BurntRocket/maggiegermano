I talk a lot about voting with your dollar and only spending money on companies that share your values. It's a very powerful action. But how realistic is it when you're on a budget? This month, we'll gather to talk about HOW we can vote with our dollar when we don't have a lot of dollars to throw around.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.

**Payment**: You will be redirected Paypal to process your payment. Once completed, you will receive an email with details for the evening.

**Refunds**: Money Circle is a limited seating event. I also purchase wine and snacks based on the number of women joining us. Because of this, if you have to cancel for any reason within 48 hours, your ticket is non-refundable. However, feel free to gift it or sell it to a friend! Just be sure to let me know of the exchange at hello@maggiegermano.com.
