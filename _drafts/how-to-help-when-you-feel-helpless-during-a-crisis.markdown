When a crisis is occurring and we are far away from it, we can feel either helpless or indifferent. When something doesn't impact us personally, it's easy to turn a blind eye. But as our world becomes more and more connected, it's more and more important to do what we can to help our fellow humans.

Over this past weekend, Hurricane Harvey, a category 4 hurricane, made landfall in Texas. So far, there has been 26 inches of rain, with more to come by the end of the week. Estimates are that there will be 50 inches of rain. This, in addition to the 130mph winds, causes incredible damage. This piece will be focused on how to help people in Houston who are suffering, but it can also apply to future crises. 

## Donate

There are so many organizations that are on the ground during times of need. There are large, international organizations like the American Red Cross. And there are local organizations that also need your donations.

## Spread the word

Maybe you don't have much money to spare. That's okay! You can still contribute by using your voice. Do you have friends or family in the affected area? Let them know who to call for help, or where to turn for support of any kind. No loved ones in the area? Let your friends know where they can donate and which organizations to support. Just because we are far away doesn't mean we can't help.

## Open your home

I read yesterday that [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com/disaster/hurricaneharveyevacuees) has created a platform where hosts can rent their space for free, and people from Houston can sign up for a place to stay. This is such a fantastic idea, as many people are unable to leave their homes due to financial limitations. If you rent out space on AirBnb, and you aren't far from Houston, I highly recommend that you offer up that space to people fleeing the hurricane.

\(AirBnb is also waiving all service fees for those affected by the hurricane and checking in between August 23rd and September 1st.)
