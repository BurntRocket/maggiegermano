I knew planning a wedding would be tough, but I didn't realize just how hard it would be. I'm a fairly organized person who is pretty good at event planning. I thought having lots of checklists would be fun! I was really wrong. So much thought goes into planning a wedding, and so much of it feels out of your control. It can feel endless and make you regret getting engaged in the first place. But I do believe there is a way to hold onto some semblance of sanity during the process. Based on my experience so far, here's my advice.

## Set Expectations

I mentioned this last week, but it's important to set expectations early on. This is especially true when it comes to family. Sit down with each set of parents (if they are around and/or involved) and ask them what they would most like to see included in the wedding. Make it clear that you're just collecting opinions, and nothing will be set in stone.

This can be a difficult conversation, like if your parents want you to have a religious ceremony, but you don't. Or it can be easy, like a parent asking for a non-religious blessing from the guests at the end of the ceremony.

## Keep Track of Your Budget

Wedding spending can get out of control. There are always costs you didn't necessarily plan for.

## Ask for Help

## Stay Attuned to Your Values

## Use a Checklist

If you've never planned a wedding before, you need a checklist to guide you.

## Get Your Partner Involved

I will never understand how one person in a couple can do all the wedding planning while the other person sits it out. Traditionally, we hear stories about the bride doing all the planning (and caring) and the groom just shows up on the wedding day. No thanks!

My fiance, Dan, is super involved in our wedding planning. In fact, he wants to get way more hands-on with things than I do. (He's making out centerpiece vessels, he designed our save-the-dates, and he will be designing our invitations and [ketubah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketubah).)
