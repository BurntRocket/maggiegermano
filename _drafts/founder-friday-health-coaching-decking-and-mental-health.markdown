## What I’m Writing

May is Mental Health Awareness Month. This week, on the blog, I wrote about how [mental health is affected by student loan debt](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/student-loan-debt-has-huge-mental-health-impacts/). 

## What I’m Up To

* The [May Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-improve-your-credit-score-tickets-60438017738) is coming up on Tuesday, May 21st! This month, we’ll be talking about how you can improve your credit score. [See you there](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-improve-your-credit-score-tickets-60438017738)?

* On the day after Money Circle, May 22nd, I’ll be sponsoring the DC event for the [Bossed Up book tour](https://www.facebook.com/events/407079006790252/)! I’ve known Emilie for years and she’s a huge reason for why I decided to start my own business. I’m excited to read her book and I’m proud to sponsor this event!

## What I’m Excited About

* I just signed up for 12 weeks of health coaching with Megan Sanchez of [Upswing Health Coaching](https://upswinghealthcoaching.com/)! Megan was the expert at our April Money Circle meetup and I liked her so much that I decided to hire her myself! I'm excited to get started and take back control of my health.

## What I’m Reading

I'm still reading *[A Princess in Theory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35271238-a-princess-in-theory)*, but I've also started *[99 Percent Mine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36300625-99-percent-mine)* by Sally Thorne. It's cute and I'm enjoying it more than *A Princess in Theory*.
