Maggie, beloved angel of dolla dolla bills. I had a pray-a-way habit prior to working with Maggie and a total allergy to tracking and planning. Maggie helped me figure out my [biz](http://jessicaleighlyons.com/) AND personal priorities and create a system that allowed me to be EXTREMELY present with money. Prior to that, I had a very binge and starve mentality. Showing up consistently and being present with my money allowed me to build the systems to take care of it.
