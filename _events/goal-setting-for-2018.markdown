2018 is upon us! I'm not really one for New Year's resolutions, because we usually abandon them quickly and then feel bad about ourselves. We need to feel truly empowered and motivated by the things we want to do in order to achieve them. So let's re-frame this tradition and set exciting goals for the year ahead.

Join a group of supportive women to get real about your goals for 2018 and beyond. These can be financial goals, or any other life goal. The most important thing is that you're specific, excited, and ready to get started. We can use this time to get ideas, and also find accountability partners.

You bring your dreams, and I'll bring the markers and wine.
