Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

We had to block off the Airbnb this week while we renovate the basement shower, so there's no Airbnb income. And I didn't have any client payments go through this week. Dan's paycheck came in today, so that's our income for the week!

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Dan and I tried out [Sun Basket](https://sunbasket.com/invite/Mary1915063) for the first time, with an introductory offer, so we were charged a low fee for our first two dinners.

* I'm currently in Orlando, Florida for [FinCon](http://www.finconexpo.com), an annual conference for financial professionals. When I check out tomorrow, I'll pay for my hotel, and I've been paying for my meals with my business credit card.

* Since I'm in Orlando, I decided to go to [Universal Studios](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/index.html), mainly to see Hogwarts. It's pretty expensive, even just for one day ($180 for both parks where there are [Harry Potter](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/universal-orlando-resort/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter/hub/index.html) attractions!), but I was told that it's really worth it. I took the 7am free shuttle from my hotel and got to the park as soon as it was opening. 

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about how you can prepare ahead of time for [holiday spending](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-plan-ahead-for-holiday-spending/). You don't have to be stressed and broke every year. Plan ahead and make your life better.

## **What I’m Up To**

Next month, [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) is meeting to talk about [how to ask for a raise](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-ask-for-a-raise/) at your current job. If you know you’ll have to do this soon, join us on October 24th!

## **What I’m Excited About**

I won an award last week! The [DC Women's Business Center](http://www.dcwbc.org/) named me the Woman Empowerment Entrepreneur of the Year! I was really surprised to win, since there were so many other amazing entrepreneurs there, but I'm also very proud!
