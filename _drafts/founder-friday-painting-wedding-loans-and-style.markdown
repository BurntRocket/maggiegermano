## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about [wedding loans](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/dont-take-out-a-wedding-loan/) and why I don't believe anyone should go into debt for their wedding day.

## **What I’m Up To**

* Last week, I was quoted in a [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/money-questions-ask-every-week-month-year-2019-7) article about what money questions you should be asking yourself.

* The [July Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-improving-your-credit-score-tickets-63873388023) is up! We’re revisiting the idea of how to improve your credit score. You’ll learn about what impacts your credit score and then what steps you need to take to improve it over time. Register today!

* I’ve been hinting at starting a podcast for a while now. But in order to make sure the podcast is interesting and helpful for YOU, I want to make sure I’m answering your questions. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit any and all money questions that you have!

## What I'm Excited About

* Daily Outfit coaching

## **What I’m Reading**

I finally finished *[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power?ac=1&from_search=true)* by Naomi Alderman. I loved the plot, but for some reason, I found it hard to get through the whole book. Now, I'm moving on to nonfiction and I'm reading *[Doing Harm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30653955-doing-harm)* by Maya Dusenbery. I'm only a few pages in and I'm already furious.
