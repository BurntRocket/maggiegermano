## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* We spent a lot of money over the weekend having fun with Dan's sister and childhood friend. So we've been reigning it in this week in order to stay within budget for the rest of the month. We bought groceries for the week on Sunday

* I bought a copy of Kristen Meinzer's book *[So You Want to Start a Podcast](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062936677/so-you-want-to-start-a-podcast/)* to get her advice while I'm getting started with mine! (PS: Listen to her podcast [By the Book](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/stitcher/by-the-book).)

## **What I’m Up To**

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-dealing-with-money-shame-tickets-66476917249) meetup is scheduled and ready for you! In August, we’ll be talking about money shame, how others feel the same way, and how to improve our relationship with our money.

## **What I’m Reading**

I finished Lori Gottlieb's book on Sunday and started the [Sawbones book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/38749668) on Monday night. I love the Sawbones podcast, so I've been enjoying the book so far.
