***We’ve all been there.*** It’s so easy to give into our capitalistic urges. Often we spend out of boredom, or sadness, or to fill a hole we feel in our life. It’s even easier these days with shopping apps literally at our fingertips. But these habits can put us into debt, curtail our goals, and make us feel bad about ourselves. So let’s get together and talk about overspending… and how to curb it. We’ll come up with tips and tricks together that will help us stick to our budget and stop overspending!

This month, I’m excited for Money Circle to be joining up with another amazing woman at her design studio! Thanks to Torie at **[Cherry Blossom Creative](http://cherryblossomcreative.com/)** for letting us use her beautiful space.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they have around money. I will provide light snacks and wine.
