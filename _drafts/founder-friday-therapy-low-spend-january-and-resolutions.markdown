Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this week.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* We spent a hefty sum on groceries this week. Not only were we hosting a New Years Day brunch, but we stocked up on some healthy essentials to keep us on track this month.

* Today, I had lunch with a friend, and fellow coach, [Heather D. Horton](https://www.heatherdhorton.com/). If you're looking for a grief coach, you should contact her!

* I finally found a new therapist who takes my insurance, and I had my initial intake session with her. Now that I'm on Dan's health insurance, I can choose an in-network therapist who is convenient to me and pay the 20% co-pay.
