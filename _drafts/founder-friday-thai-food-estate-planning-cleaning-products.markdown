## How I Spent Money This Week

* I received a $100 Amazon gift card this week, so I decided to treat myself. I bought a couple books that I've been wanting, a puzzle, and a makeup organizer for the top of my dresser. I still have half of the gift card amount left, but I want to let it sit so I can decide what else I want to treat myself with. 

* We use [Branch Basics](http://branchbasics.refr.cc/marygermano) for our at-home cleaning products. It's non-toxic and saves lots of money and plastic. There is a large bottle of concentrate that you mix with different amounts of water for different types of cleaning solutions, including hand soap. We recently ran out of the concentrate after nearly a year, so I ordered another bottle this week. (Get $10 off your first order when you use [my link](http://branchbasics.refr.cc/marygermano)!)

## What I’m Writing

This week, I republished my [ForbesWomen](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/despite-their-priorities-nearly-half-of-americans-over-55-still-dont-have-a-will/) piece about why it's so important to get your estate planning documents in order.

## What I’m Up To

* I was featured in [FinanciElle](https://financielle.wordpress.com/2019/03/16/maggie-germano-founder-and-ceo-of-maggie-germano-financial-coaching/) this week!

* On Wednesday, March 27th, I’ll be hosting Money Circle. We’ll be joined by personal style coach, [Allison Hamilton-Rohe](https://dailyoutfit.com/), since our topic is: [How To Create a Powerful Personal Style On A Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-create-a-powerful-personal-style-on-a-budget-tickets-54939672038).

* The [April Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-honoring-self-care-keeping-your-pockets-full-tickets-59004572264) meet up is ready for registration! We'll be joined by Megan Sanchez of Upswing Health Coaching to talk about prioritizing self care while on a budget.

* I want to hear from you! As I am continuing to create blog content and expanding my work into online courses, a podcast, and more workshops, I want to make sure I’m creating things that are useful to YOU. I’ve made a survey for my clients and readers to hear about what you most want to learn about.
