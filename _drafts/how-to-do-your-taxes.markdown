It's the most wonderful time of the year! Just kidding, it's tax season. If you're traditionally employed, you should have received your W-2 by now, which means you have most of what you need to file your taxes.

## Give Yourself Plenty of Time

Tax Day is April 15th, which means it's the last day you can file your taxes without them being late. April may seem like it's really far away, but time has a way of speeding up when you're avoiding something. Before you know it, it's 10pm on Tax Day and you're furiously trying to finish filing your taxes. Don't let that be you! Start early so that you have time to finish things without stress. You never know what might come up, or if you're missing documents you need. Start gathering your needed information now and set a deadline that is sooner than April 15th. 

## Gather All Your Paperwork

Like I mentioned above, you should have received your W-2 by January 31st.

## Find An Online Tax Platform

There are so many ways to do your taxes on your own. 

## Ask For Help

Taxes can be overwhelming and scary. They are not designed in a way that is easy for people to understand. Plus, we aren't taught how to do our taxes in school. So how are you supposed to know what you're doing if no one ever taught you? Cut yourself some slack if you feel like you have no idea what you're doing. Then, ask for help. If your parents used to do your taxes for you, reach out to them for advice. Maybe they can walk you through it. Perhaps you have friends who get their taxes done in the blink of an eye every year. Ask them how they do it and see if they have time to answer your questions. If your tax issues are more complicated than just knowing how the process works, reach out to a professional. It may cost extra up front, but it can save you from owing money later if you made an error.
