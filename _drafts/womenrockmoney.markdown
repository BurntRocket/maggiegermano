Happy International Women's Day! Today is the day that people around the world celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. It's also a day to encourage efforts to improve the lives of women and girls everywhere. As a financial coach, I believe that financial security is one of the key drivers to women's empowerment. I use coaching and blogging as a way to provide women with the tools and support they need to take control of their money. Today, I'm presenting my most important money advice to help women get started on their money journey.

## Know Your Stuff

Knowledge is power, truly. It's really easy to avoid and ignore your financial issues, but that keeps you out of control. It's important to push through the anxiety and get a good grip on what's going on with your money. 

## Advocate for Yourself

It can be hard to speak up for yourself as a woman, since we've been socialized to be nice and not cause trouble. But no one but you can ask for what you need.

How are you celebrating International Women's Day today? Are you striking from work? Are you refusing to do any housework? I'm going to a [fundraiser](https://www.facebook.com/events/277506966117621/) of [Planned Parenthood of Metro Washington](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-metropolitan-washington-dc)!
