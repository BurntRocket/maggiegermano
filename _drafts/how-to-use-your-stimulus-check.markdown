Like many Americans, you may have received your stimulus check via direct deposit already. If you haven't yet received your deposit, or if you will get the money via check, visit this [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments) to get an update on your money. The site also gives you the opportunity to input your bank information so that you can get your money via direct deposit. The system has been pretty overloaded, so if it takes a couple of tries, or if you get an error message, keep at it.

When you do get the money, though, you might be wondering what you should do with it. Of course, that answer is going to depend on your circumstances. But here are some tips:

## Cover Your Necessities

The main reason we are even getting these stimulus checks is to tide us over during this crisis. The most important thing to do is make sure that you and your family have what they need to survive. So if you are losing any income during this time, you should make sure that you at least can put food on the table. Focus on things like food, medication, and other things that you and your family need in order to get by and maintain your health. 

## Pay Your Bills

If you know your necessities will be covered, you should use this money to pay your bills. However, it's also a good idea to try to keep as much cash on hand right now so that you don't risk going into debt trying to cover necessities. The idea is that people will be using this money to pay their bills and cover their necessities

call and have bills delayed etc

## Pad Your Savings

If you don't have an emergency fund, or if you have one but it's small, you should use as much of this money as possible to help fund your savings. If COVID-19 doesn't show everyone why an emergency fund is so important, I don't know what will.

## Pay Down Debt

If you have a consistent income right now, you know that your necessities will be covered, AND you have some cash in savings, it's a good idea to 

## Invest In Your Community

If you still have your job and feel confident that you can cover your expenses and other priorities, consider investing in your community. Many of us are not in the position to do this, so don't feel guilty if you need to keep the whole stimulus check for yourself. But if you are lucky enough to have your needs cover, you can give back to your community in a few ways:

Buy from local businesses:

* Restaurants

* Liquor stores

* Book stores

* Artists

* Small grocery stores

Donate to local organizations:

* Food pantries

* Soup kitchens

* Nonprofits helping those in need

As always, you should put your own oxygen mask on first, literally and metaphorically. Take care of your needs first. Pay for your necessities, pay your bills, build up your savings, and pay off debt. Once you've been able to do that, then you can give to others.
