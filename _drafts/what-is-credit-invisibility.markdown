You've probably heard of bad credit or good credit, credit scores and credit reports. But have you ever heard of the term "credit invisible"? Probably not! Credit invisibility is when a person has no credit history whatsoever. This means that they have nothing in their history to say that they have good credit or bad credit. There's just no credit at all. In 2015, the [Consumer Finance Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/who-are-credit-invisible/) found that 26 million Americans are actually credit invisible.

## Why Does It Matter?

Your credit history and credit score determine what you will or won't be approved for. This can affect your ability to get a home loan, a car loan, a student loan, a credit card, etc. 

## How to Become Credit Visible

Getting approved for credit is a lot like getting a job. You need experience in order to get hired, but you can't get experience without hired chosen first! But there are ways to prove yourself as a responsible cardholder even if you don't have the credit history that creditors prefer. 

* **Get a Secured Credit Card**

When I first graduated from college, I had never had a credit card, but I knew that I wanted to get one. My parents recommended that I get a secured credit card through their credit union. The card had a very low limit of $500 so that I wouldn't be able to overspend too much. I had to put $500 (let's be honest, my parents gave me the money) in a CD as collateral. This meant that if I maxed out my credit card but wasn't able to pay it back, the bank had the CD to pay themselves with. 

A secured credit card is helpful for you and your creditor. You're able to build your credit while also not putting yourself at risk over going way into debt. Your creditor isn't putting itself at too much risk because your limit is low and there is usually collateral for them to pull from.

Talk to your bank and see if they offer a secured credit card option!

* **Get Added As An Authorized User**

A very easy way to build or improve your credit is to be added as an authorized user on someone's credit card.

Of course, you should make sure that you trust the person who is adding you as an authorized user. If you get added and then the account holder misses payments, your credit history will be harmed. You'll want to make sure that the main account holder will make their payments on time and keep their debt to credit ratio low. 

* **Have Someone Co-Sign a Loan**

If you need to get a loan but you have no credit, you can get someone to co-sign it for you. This tells the creditor that 

* **Get Credit for the Rent You Pay**

Unfortunately, if you're being a responsible adult and paying your rent every month, the credit bureaus typically don't know that. However, you can sign up for rent-reporting services, such as [Rental Kharma](https://rentalkharma.com/) and [RentTrack](https://www.renttrack.com/), that take bills you're already paying and report them to the credit bureaus.
