## How I Spent Money This Week

* I'm trying out a new meal delivery service. Dan and I have been terrible about eating well ever since we moved into our house almost a year ago. With our wedding staring us down, we want to get serious about eating healthy so we can feel our best on our wedding day and beyond. I put in an order for [Sun Basket](http://www.sunbasket.com), using the "lean and clean" option. I'm excited to see how it goes. If you want to get $40 off your first order, [use my link](https://sunbasket.com/invite/Mary1915063)!

## What I’m Writing

* In honor of Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, I wrote a piece about why you should separate your self worth from your net worth.

* I wrote an extra post this week about how you can start protecting your reproductive health, in case the Supreme Court ends up having a majority of anti-choice justices.

## What I’m Up To

## What I’m Excited About

* I'm excited for FinCon, which is coming up next week! It's a huge conference for financial bloggers and other financial professionals. This will be my third time attending, and I'm really looking forward to it. *Will you be there? Send me a note so we can meet up!*
