Most articles about holiday spending and budgeting focus on giving gifts. Of course, I've already written [several](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-create-a-holiday-gift-budget/) of the [same](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-chasing-sales-can-actually-blow-your-budget/)! This week, though, I want to talk about how to stay on budget if you're traveling for the holidays.

There are many costs associated with holiday travel. Whether you're traveling by plane, bus, train, or car, the costs can get out of hand if you're not careful. Here are some basic rules you can follow to keep your expenses low.

## Plan Ahead

I know you know that prices sky rocket as the holidays get closer.

## Pack Food

Like with everything, if you have few options to choose from, you'll be more inclined to spend extra. The same goes for food at places like the airport or train station. Meals and snacks are marked up to a lot more than you would pay normally. Plus, most airport food is very unhealthy. So kill two birds with one stone and pack your meals and snacks.
