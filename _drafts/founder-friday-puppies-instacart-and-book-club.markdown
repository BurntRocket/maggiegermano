Happy Friday! I hope you’re staying warm out there. Here’s what I was up to this week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We have one Airbnb guest this week, who is coming to the DC area for the Women's March.

* I had two new clients pay their monthly fees.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* As you know, if you're in the DC area, we got a bunch of snow on Saturday and Sunday. Dan and I needed to replenish some of our groceries, but we didn't want to be on the road. I didn't think we could last a couple days without these items, so I fired up my Instacart account and had groceries delivered. Luckily, the delivery person arrived just as Dan was finishing shoveling our driveway and sidewalk. (Use [my Instacart link](https://inst.cr/t/2SPbdAMbW) for $10 off your first order!)

## What I’m Writing

ICYMI: I [republished](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/investors-think-they-are-fair-but-minority-owned-businesses-are-left-out/) my [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2018/12/11/investors-think-they-are-fair-but-minority-owned-businesses-are-left-out/) post about the divide between how often investors *think* they're investing in minority-owned businesses and how often they actually *do*. (If you haven't already, ["follow" me](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/) on ForbesWomen so you always know when I publish a new post!)

## What I’m Up To

* The [January Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-financial-resolutions-that-last-tickets-54309667678) is scheduled and ready for you! This month, we’ll be joined by financial advisor Deri Freeman, and we will talk about how to set financial resolutions that will last, and identify which goals you want to start with. We only have a couple spots left! [Register here!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-financial-resolutions-that-last-tickets-54309667678)

* If you can't make the January meetup, the [February event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-showing-your-love-on-a-budget-tickets-54758999642) is scheduled and open for registration! If gift-giving is one of your love languages, this event is for you!

* I’m running a low-spend month for January among Money Circle members! If you want to join us, make sure you’re in the [Money Circle group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MoneyCircleGroup), so you can see all my tips and ask for support if you need it!

* This year, I have big goals that will allow me to reach more of you at a level that is more affordable. I plan to launch my podcast and create online courses. I plan to do more speaking engagements and host more workshops. What kinds of topics and issues would you want to see me cover online and in person? Share in the comments or email me at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com)!

## What I'm Excited About

* Dan and I are going to meet a puppy this weekend!
