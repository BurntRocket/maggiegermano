As of December 2017, there was over $1 trillion in revolving debt in the United States. When divided by the number of adults who have credit cards, that averages out to over $5,000 of credit card debt per person. Some people have more, some people have less. But the fact is, many, many people are dealing with credit card debt in the United States. 

Yet, it's unclear for many people how to manage that debt. And many feel alone and ashamed of their debt. But clearly, if you're in debt, you are far from alone! Join us at Money Circle to learn strategies and solutions to tackle your credit card debt. Don't be afraid to share your balances and struggles with spending and debt. Money Circle is a no-judgment space, and we're all in this together.

One of the most important things in life is the sense of community - feeling like you’re not alone. This is especially true when it comes to issues that bring us shame and confusion.

We live in a society where money is an unspoken taboo. We aren’t supposed to ask people how much money they earn, and women especially have a hard time knowing and asking for what they are worth. It’s more important than ever to band together and put it all on the table.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.
