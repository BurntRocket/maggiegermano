[Last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/celebrating-my-2019-wins/), I wrote about what I accomplished in 2019. It is always really helpful for me to look back and really write out all of the great things that happened the year before. I tend to focus on what I didn't do or what didn't go well, so I often forget what was actually truly great. So the celebration exercise always makes me feel better. Something I don't always do is set specific goals for the coming year.
