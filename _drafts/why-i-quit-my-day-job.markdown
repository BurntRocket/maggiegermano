On Tuesday, December 5, 2017, I told my boss that I would be resigning from my position at the end of the month. I was so nervous that my hands were shaking. I could even hear my voice trembling as I spoke. I had been pumping myself up to quit for days, and the anticipation was really stoking my anxiety. 

Once the words were out, I could feel my body relax with relief. My boss was surprised and definitely sad that I was leaving, but she was incredibly supportive. She knew I was running my business on the side, so she was excited that I felt ready to pursue it full-time.
