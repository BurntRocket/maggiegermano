Happy Friday! I hope you’re staying dry and warm out there. Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Groceries

* We haven't spent this money yet, but Dan and I are going to [Tiki TNT](https://www.tikitnt.com/) at the Wharf tonight. We try to find tiki bars in the cities that we visit, so we have to finally check out one that is in our own city!

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, in honor of Black History Month, I wrote about how [systemic racism](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/the-economic-effects-of-racism/) has long-lasting economic effects.

* On Wednesday, March 6th, I will be at the [Lemon Collective](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aligning-your-money-with-your-values-tickets-54778910195) leading a workshop on how to align your money with your values.

* On Tuesday, March 12th, I will be at [Mindspace](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-tickets-55047193638) leading a workshop called Making & Breaking the Budget. If you struggle with creating and sticking to a budget, this one is for you!

* On Wednesday, March 27th, I’ll be hosting Money Circle. We’ll be joined by personal style coach, Allison Hamilton-Rohe, since our topic is: [How To Create a Powerful Personal Style On A Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-create-a-powerful-personal-style-on-a-budget-tickets-54939672038).

## **What I’m Excited About**

* If you've been following along, you know that Dan and I have been trying to find a corgi puppy to add to our family. We had two rescues fall through so we've started reaching out to local breeders. This weekend, we're driving to Powhatan, VA to visit a breeder and meet her corgi puppies. She's the first person we've spoken to who has puppies available without a huge waitlist!
