***Content warning:** this article makes references to abusive relationships, particularly those where financial abuse is in play. If you are experiencing financial (or any kind of) abuse, there is help out there for you. **You are not alone, and you are not to blame.** You can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at **1-800-799-SAFE**. Reach out to organizations like [Purple Purse](http://purplepurse.com/) and the [National Network to End Domestic Violence](http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=14107&state_code=PG&open_id=all) for information and support.*

This month is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. As I mentioned [last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/3-financial-hurdles-that-keep-women-in-abusive-relationships/), 1 in 4 women will experience intimate partner violence in their lives. And the truth is, when physical and emotional violence are involved, they typically aren't the only tool of abuse that are used. In fact, financial abuse is present in 98 percent of abusive relationships, which means that it is a very common tactic. 

Financial abuse is when money is being used as a tool of control or abuse. It can range from subtle to overt, and that's why it can be difficult to identify, even if it's happening to you.
