Happy Friday! I've been thoroughly enjoying the springlike weather in DC this week. It makes me so happy to have lots of sunshine and not be sweating profusely whenever I walk outside. Anyway, here's what I was up to this week!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* June is another lucrative week for our Airbnb! We've had guests all week, and will have them through the weekend and next week. Like I've said before, the payments go through the day the guests arrive, so we don't have to wait too long to get paid.

* One of my monthly clients' regular payments went through on Sunday

* A new client purchased a one-time financial coaching session.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I are making a concerted effort to eat well for the month of June. I also got a warning from my doctor about my cholesterol, so it's about more than just feeling and looking good now. We're trying out the [Flat Belly Diet](https://www.amazon.com/Flat-Belly-Diet-Liz-Vaccariello/dp/1250013356), which focuses on filling your diet with good fats that are good for your heart and help combat belly fat. We spent a ton of money at Costco on Sunday getting all of the bulk items we need for the month. We also spent a good amount on other items at Safeway. The good thing is, we won't be spending any money going out to eat, so the costs should even out really well.

* We found really cute thank you cards on Amazon that we'll send out after our wedding. I was a little stressed out about the prospect of spending hundreds of dollars on another paper item for the wedding, so I was relieved to find cards on Amazon that Dan and I both liked. Bonus: They were only $20 for 100! I also bought a different set of thank you cards specifically to send out after my bridal shower. As luck would have it, they almost perfectly match the invitations my little sister picked out.

* My friend Rachel recently turned me onto Poshmark when I complained that the outfit I wanted to wear for my rehearsal dinner was sold out. I've definitely been going down a rabbit hole looking at discounted shoes and other items. The Rothy's shoes I really wanted to wear to my wedding are no longer being made, and I haven't been able to find them anywhere. So I kept poking around Poshmark to see if there's anything else that catches my eye. I found a really cute pair of teal flats and haggled them for only $15! If I love them as much as I think I will, they'll be my wedding shoes. We did the same thing for Dan and found a pair of dress shoes that are exactly what he was looking for. But instead of paying over $200 for them, we paid only $25! Hell yes for Poshmark! (If you want $5 off your first Poshmark order, use the code **"MAGGERMANO"** when you sign up!)

* One of the more irritating homeowner projects we've undertaken is getting rid of the bamboo in our back yard. Bamboo is incredibly invasive and the local birds don't like it. We (foolishly) thought it wouldn't be too complicated to cut down and get rid of, but it's actually the worst. After spending two full weekend days on it, getting covered in cuts, and barely making a dent, we decided to hire someone to do it for us. The company we ended up hiring gave us a great price and is also going to cut down some small dying trees and clean up the overgrowth around the rest of the yard. This is one of the home expenses I'm feeling fantastic about!

## What I’m Writing

For the month of June, I'm writing blog posts about questions I've been asked by clients and [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) members. This week, I wrote about what your options are for [student loan debt consolidation](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-are-my-options-for-student-loan-consolidation/). I hope it helps!

## What I’m Excited About

* We're going to the Dominican Republic in three weeks! My grandma is taking the entire family to an all-inclusive resort for a week. I cannot wait! We got our travel information in the mail from the travel agent this week, which makes it even more exciting. Do you have any recommendations in La Romana, DR?

* **I'm offering [20% off one-time financial coaching sessions](https://maggiegermanofinancialcoaching.as.me/onetimediscount) in the month of June!** We're halfway through 2018, and this is usually the time we realize we haven't made progress on our goals for the year. If you want some help getting back on track with your finances, let's talk!

## What I’m Up To

* The [June Money Circle meetup](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-make-a-budget/) is on June 20th! We’ll be gathering to talk about budgeting basics and we'll create our own budgets. I’ll be there to guide you and answer your questions. Join us!

* I’m teaming up with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/mo-money-mo-worries-get-financially-savvy-in-2018/washington-dc/49127) on Tuesday, June 26th for a free personal finance workshop in Navy Yard. See you there?
