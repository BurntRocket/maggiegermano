Happy Friday! I'm back from my honeymoon and ready to start reporting back about my week again. Do you find these weekly reviews useful or interesting? Let me know in the comments!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We're back in the Airbnb game after taking November off while we were gone. We had one guest stay with us this week.

* A couple of my clients' monthly payments went through this week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* After 3 weeks away, Dan and I were lacking in fresh food and produce. We went to Safeway and stocked up on healthy ingredients for multiple crockpot meals.

* I went through a bit of a Christmas craze this past weekend. Dan and I bought a real Christmas tree from a Lutheran church down the street, bought a fake wreath and garland from Home Depot, and went a little overboard on cute stuff at Target. The living room looks so cozy now and most of what we bought are things we can reuse every year.

* Hopefully this isn't TMI, but we also ordered some underwear from [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/r/marygermano) this week. Both of us need an upgrade in this department, so we're trying out [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/r/marygermano), since they are pretty good quality.

* My dear, dear friend Liz is getting married tomorrow! Her wedding is black tie, so I am trying [Rent the Runway](https://rtr.app.link/e/DYZJuG2MqS) *(get $30 off your first order if you use my link!)* for the first time ever. I spent $50 to try two different dresses, which I think is a pretty good deal! They should arrive tonight, and I'm eager to see how they fit.

* We spent a bunch of money today... but luckily we're spending wedding gift money on a few things we've been wanting to buy. They were bigger ticket items that we haven't wanted to splurge on before, but now we have a little cash to cover the cost. *(Curious how you should spend your wedding gift money? Check out [my post](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-should-i-do-with-my-wedding-gift-money/) on this very topic!)*

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I got real about the [mistakes I made](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/5-mistakes-i-made-while-planning-my-wedding/) while planning my wedding. Check it out and learn from my mistakes so you don't do that same!

## **What I’m Up To**

* Did you catch my latest [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2018/11/06/why-and-how-women-must-prepare-differently-for-the-future/) piece about how and why women need to plan for their futures differently?

* This went live while I was in Thailand, but the episode of the live [Bossed Up podcast](https://bossedup.org/episode72/) taping in DC is up! A bunch of awesome ladies and I talked about women and wealth.

## **What I’m Excited About**

I was a finalist for the Entrepreneurship for Good award at [WIN's](https://winonline.org/) [YWA awards](https://winonline.org/events/young-women-of-achievement-awards/2018-young-women-achievement-awards/) this week! Dallas Thompson, president and founder of [Bright Compass](https://www.thebrightcompass.com/), ultimately won the award, and it was so well deserved. I was honored to be nominated with the rest of these amazing women!
