Dan and I are getting married this Saturday (!!!???). It's been a pretty long engagement, and if we could do it over again, I'd rather get married sooner and spend much less time planning a wedding. But here we are, finally.

A couple of months ago, we teamed up with a therapist for pre-marital counseling. It was important to me for us to prepare for marriage by going through this counseling. We had attended an 8-hour pre-marital workshop in January and enjoyed it, but I knew we'd benefit from more support.

## Figure Out Your Budget

We struggled with finding a pre-marital therapist who takes insurance. In fact, I couldn't find one at all that was taking new clients. It was so frustrating! And I've heard my friends having the same problem, so you should prepare for that possibility and start planning accordingly.

Even though we would have to pay out of pocket, it was important to me, so I was willing to make the investment. I allocated a portion of my monthly income one month to make it happen.

## Find a Therapist in that Budget

Once you've figured out your budget, and whether or not your insurance will cover this endeavor, it's time to find a therapist. 

We used someone from the Imago Center in DC, because they focus specifically on romantic relationships. Imago therapists ran the workshop we attended in January, and we enjoyed their approach. So we found an Imago therapist whose office was actually right across the street from our house! That made it a lot easier to have our 90-minute sessions in the morning so Dan didn't have to miss too much work (this is an important thing to consider!). 

## Schedule Your Sessions

Our therapist said that four to five 90-minute sessions is the typical amount that her clients commit to.

## Put in the Work

Just like with most self-work, the work you do IN the session is not the only work you need to do. If your therapist gives you homework, do it, and don't just do it five minutes before your session. Practice the communication tactics that you learn in the sessions. Keep in mind the things that your partner has mentioned. Pre-marital counseling (just like any therapy) won't be effective if you're not taking the lessons home with you.

## Don't End the Conversation There

After pre-marital counseling is done, all of your problems are not miraculously solved. You have to continue communicating your needs and practicing effective communication. For us, pre-marital counseling actually brought up several things that we need to discuss more and work on.
