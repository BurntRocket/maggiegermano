Last September, my fiance, Dan, and I closed on a house near Hyattsville, MD. It's right next to a new Whole Foods, a Gold's Gym, and several other fun spots. It also cost about $100,000 less than a lot of other houses in the area, because it needed quite a bit of work. I thought it was a great investment to buy a livable fixer-upper in a good location, because we'd spend less on fixing it up than we would if we bought a house that had already been flipped. Plus, it had everything I was looking for in a home: a big front porch, a master suite on its own floor, a finished basement with its own separate entrance, a room for my home office, and pretty big backyard. It's also about a mile from the metro, so I can walk there or take the bus easily.
