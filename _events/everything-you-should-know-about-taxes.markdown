If you're like many Americans, you probably don't know much about taxes. Yes, you see them taken out of your paychecks and you know you have to file your taxes before April 15th. But what does all of that really mean? Where does your tax money go? What do you need to know about potential tax policy changes that could impact you?

Join the October Money Circle to learn the answers to these questions! Hannah Finnie from youth advocate organization [Generation Progress](http://genprogress.org/) will be in attendance to discuss how national conversations and proposals on taxes could impact millennial women.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.

**Payment:** You will be redirected Paypal to process your payment. Once completed, you will receive an email with details for the evening.

**Refunds:** Money Circle is a limited seating event. I also purchase wine and snacks based on the number of women joining us. Because of this, if you have to cancel for any reason within 24 hours, your ticket is non-refundable. However, feel free to gift it or sell it to a friend! Just be sure to let me know of the exchange at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com).
