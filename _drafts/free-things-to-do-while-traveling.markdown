## Hiking

## Tours

Last month, I was in Colorado for about a week. One activity I like to do while traveling is go on brewery tours. I'm a beer fan, and I always find it interesting to see what different breweries are like.

## Museums

Not all cities have free museums. In fact, I feel pretty spoiled having lived in DC for 8 years. We have so many free museums that I'm always shocked when I have to pay to go in one somewhere else. But

## Gardens

In Portland last week, I went to the International Rose Garden. It was beautiful AND free. Plus it gave us a great view of the city.
