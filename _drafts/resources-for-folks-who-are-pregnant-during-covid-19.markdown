## CDC Guidelines

It can be difficult to know where to turn for up-to-date, accurate, information during times of crisis. It's even worse because there's a lot of misinformation out there right now. However, the folks at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have dedicated their lives to the study and control of disease, so they are a great place to start. It's still somewhat unsure how COVID-19 affects pregnant people and their fetuses, but there is new information being released everyday. [Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html) at their resource about pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## WHO Guidelines

Just like the CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO) is a trustworthy resource for COVID-19 information and updates. It might even be more trustworthy right now, since it is not an American federal agency [Learn more](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/emergencies/COVID-19-pregnancy-ipc-breastfeeding-infographics/en/) at their resource about pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding.
