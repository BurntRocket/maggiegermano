I've written [in the past](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-are-your-options-for-debt-consolidation/) about using a balance transfer in order to consolidate your debt or lower your interest rates. It is a method that I often hear about from my friends and clients. Basically, you transfer the balance of one credit card to another credit card. This is usually done to take advantage of low or no interest offers. Sounds like a great deal, right? It can be! But it's important to know both the pros *and* cons of this approach before you dive in. 

**Pros:**

* **No Interest Fees: **The whole point of doing a balance transfer is to take advantage of low or no-interest offers. That means that for a certain period of time, you can pay down your debt without paying any interest on it. This saves a lot of money and can make it easier and more manageable to pay off your debt. 

* More Time: Most introductory offers last from about 12 to 18 months. That means that you get up to a year and a half to pay down your debt without 

**Cons:**

* **Origination Fees: **Credit card companies aren't just giving you a zero-interest offer out of the goodness of their hearts. You do have to pay a fee in order to make the balance transfer. This fee can typically range between 3 and 5 percent of the balance being transferred. Depending on the amount of debt you have, that can add up to a lot of extra money for you to pay back. Do the math to see if the interest you'd be otherwise paying will be more than the origination fee so that it's worth your while. 

* Time Limit: 

* **More Credit:** A danger of balance transfers is that you'll continue to use the credit card after you've paid off your debt. That risks building up the debt again. If you know that you struggle with spending and debt, it might be better to consolidate with a personal loan and cut up your credit cards. Of course, if you do the balance transfer and then cut up the card itself, you'll prevent yourself from using it.
