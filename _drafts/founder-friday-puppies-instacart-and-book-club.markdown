Happy Friday! I hope you’re staying warm out there. Here’s what I was up to this week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had one Airbnb guest this week.

* I had one former full-time client sign on as a retainer client.

* I had two new clients pay their monthly fees.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* We used some of our wedding gift money to buy ourselves a robot vacuum! We’re planning to get a dog within the next couple months, and I wanted to get ahead of the impending fur.

* We had to stock up on a few household items, like sponges, plastic wrap, and aluminum foil, so I bought those things on Amazon.

## **What I’m Up To**

* The [January Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-financial-resolutions-that-last-tickets-54309667678) is scheduled and ready for you! This month, we’ll be joined by financial advisor Deri Freeman, and we will talk about how to set financial resolutions that will last, and identify which goals you want to start with. We only have a couple spots left! [Register here!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-financial-resolutions-that-last-tickets-54309667678)

* If you can't make the January meetup, the [February event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-showing-your-love-on-a-budget-tickets-54758999642) is scheduled and open for registration! If gift-giving is one of your love languages, this event is for you!

* I’m running a low-spend month for January among Money Circle members! If you want to join us, make sure you’re in the [Money Circle group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MoneyCircleGroup), so you can see all my tips and ask for support if you need it!

* This year, I have big goals that will allow me to reach more of you at a level that is more affordable. I plan to launch my podcast and create online courses. I plan to do more speaking engagements and host more workshops. What kinds of topics and issues would you want to see me cover online and in person? Share in the comments or email me at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com)!
