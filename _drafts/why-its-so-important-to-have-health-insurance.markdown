After the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) was passed in 2010, it became required for everyone to have health insurance coverage. Those who didn't get covered would get financially penalized. This was to encourage people who weren't previously covered to enroll in health insurance. Effective January 2019, the individual mandate is no longer law. Regardless of how you personally feel about that, it's still important for you to have health insurance. And here's why:

## Healthcare is the Ultimate Self Care

We tout self care all the time these days. And that's great! But on Instagram, it usually takes the simple form of a bubble bath or a shopping spree. The truth is, real self care takes more planning and effort than that. A lot of the time, it's boring, responsible stuff.

This amounts to an estimated 530,000 families each year. That's a lot of people being forced into bankruptcy due to medical costs. That's why it's so important to make sure that you have adequate health insurance, so you can try to avoid the sort of debt that could be insurmountable.

## Preventative Medicine Saves You Problems Later

It should go without saying that preventing disease is the better and more affordable option when it comes to medical costs. And preventative medicine is actually covered 100% under the Affordable Care Act. That means that well women physicals and annual physicals are covered without requiring a copay. Going to these appointments can prevent issues or catch them early, which makes treatment and recovery easier and less expensive. Have you had your well women visit yet this year? 

## You'll Have Access to Your Medication

One of the most important parts of health insurance is getting coverage for your necessary or desired medications. In my life, I have at one point taken these kinds of medications: birth control, thyroid medication, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medication, ...

## It's Better For Society

As I mentioned in [today's podcast episode](www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/why-its-so-important-to-have-health-insurance/), it's better for society as a whole if everyone has health insurance.
