Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* I held a workshop at the Lemon Collective this Wednesday. We had a great turnout!

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* As you probably saw last week, my husband and I got a puppy over the weekend! We've named him Bruno and he's adorable and sooo much work. We're quickly learning how easy it is to spend lots of money on a puppy. On Monday, we took him to his first wellness exam at the vet, which cost $99, including the price of one vaccine. 

* We also signed Bruno up for pet insurance through Healthy Paws. We paid for his first month's premium.

* 

* We paid the remaining balance for our new privacy fence. Luckily, we have that money already set aside in savings.
