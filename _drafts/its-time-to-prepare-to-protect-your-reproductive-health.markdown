If you've been conscious at all within the last few months (or the last two years), you know that there is a new Supreme Court nominee being vetted by the Senate. Brett Kavanaugh is.... You also probably know that President Trump promised to appoint a Supreme Court Justice who would overturn [Roe v. Wade](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/roe-v-wade).

What you should also know is that Brett Kavanaugh, in his testimony, referred to birth control as "abortion inducing". If you know anything about birth control or abortion, you know that birth control, including Plan B, does not cause abortion. In fact, it prevents pregnancy, which means it also prevents abortion. However, misinformation abounds, and Brett Kavanaugh is likely willfully ignorant about birth control. The problem with this ignorance, though, is that it puts birth control at risk. We already have Congress fighting the birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act. If we have a majority conservative Supreme Court, it could be fought there as well. (Listen to [Dan Savage’s rant](https://www.savagelovecast.com/episodes/620#.W5pqlZNKjBI) about this.)

## Find An Employer That Supports Women

This might seem straight forward, but there are a lot of companies out there that don’t want to pay for your birth control. They don’t want to pay for your pre- and post-natal care. They don’t want to pay for your maternity leave. This puts their female employees at risk of not being able to afford their own healthcare, which could mean they go into debt, forego other important bills, or give up that part of their healthcare altogether. It also means they don’t have control over their own health, bodies, and life.

When you’re interviewing for jobs, find out about their policies on maternity (and paternity or general “family”) leave. Find out if their health insurance plan covers birth control and/or abortion (though the abortion part will likely be difficult for you to find out). While you’re at it, find out about their sexual harassment policies, since harassment and it’s fallout can hurt you financially, emotionally, and physically

## Get an IUD or Implant

[Implants](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-implanon) can last up to 3 years and [IUDs](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud) can last up to 10 years, depending on the type that you choose. As of now, unless you work for a "religious" company, birth control is still covered by insurance. If you know you won't want a child between now and 3-10 years from now, it might be a good time to get an implant or IUD inserted. 

Of course, each person reacts differently to all birth control options. 

## Stock Up On The Morning-After Pill

Most women who have sex with men probably know what it's like to have a pregnancy scare or have their birth control fail in some way. Pills like Plan B are a great medication that prevents pregnancy by temporarily stopping the release of an egg from the ovary, preventing fertilization, and preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus. Taking the [morning-after pill](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/whats-plan-b-morning-after-pill) can reduce your likelihood of getting pregnant by 75-89% if you take it within three days of intercourse. 

The morning-after pill isn't cheap. It costs about $40 per box (depending on the brand), so this isn't a viable option for all women. But if you're worried that this medication will be taken away from us, it is a good idea to stock up on it. They even sell them on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=morning\+after\+pill).

## Designate a Reproductive Health Savings Account

As scary as this is, sometimes all of the above might not be enough. If you know for a fact that you don’t want to become a parent now or ever, you have to financially plan for that. If Roe v. Wade or [Griswold v. Connecticut](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/birth-control/griswold-v-connecticut) is overturned, you’ll need back up cash.

When abortion was illegal before 1974, that didn’t mean no one was getting abortions. When birth control was illegal, that didn’t mean no one was trying to prevent pregnancy. It meant that women (usually white) with money had access to these services because they could travel and pay a premium. Low-income women and women of color didn’t necessarily have those options. So they either took care of things themselves, or they paid nonreputable people to help them. This led to injury, infection, infertility, and death.

I hope we don’t go back to that time, but in case we do, you need to protect yourself by creating this emergency savings account.
