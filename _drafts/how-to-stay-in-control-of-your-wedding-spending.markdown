So I've talked about [creating a wedding budget](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-create-a-wedding-budget/), [keeping your sanity while planning](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-plan-a-wedding-and-stay-sane/), and making sure you're [infusing your own values into the process](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-im-incorporating-values-into-my-wedding/). But even if you do all of those things, spending can still get out of control when you're planning a wedding. And it's so normal! Weddings are designed to be expensive, and there's a lot of pressure to make it look and feel perfect. But there are still things you can do to prevent yourself from going over budget. Here's how to can maintain control over your wedding spending.

## Don't Buy Decorations Early

I have heard this on the Bridechilla podcast a few times. People get engaged and go hog wild buying decorations and other items for their wedding. And then when they get closer to their wedding, they realize they don't even want or need most of the stuff they bought! So not only did they spend money they didn't need to spend, but now they have a bunch of stuff they don't know what to do with.

Getting engaged is exciting and it can be super tempting to get a head start on the fun parts of wedding planning. But it might be more helpful to wait and get a good idea of your wedding day vision first.

## Pay for the Important Stuff First

How terrible would it be if you spent a ton of money on random wedding stuff and then didn't have enough left in your budget to pay for booze? Or the photographer? Or any other vendor that is essential? Pretty terrible! So it's important to start your budget and spending with the big ticket items like: catering, photography, venue, DJ, alcohol, clothing, etc. Once you have all of those items priced out and checked off, you can start adding in other things.

## Track Everything

Tracking spending is always important, but that's especially true when you're spending large amounts.

## Stay Away From Pinterest and Instagram

FOMO is real. And social media makes it so easy to compare ourselves to others and feel less-than. This is especially true with the wedding industrial complex.

## Be Careful of How Much You DIY

It can seem more affordable to do things yourself for your wedding. Flowers, decorations, food, etc.

## Add a 10% Buffer

I actually didn't consider this until I applied [A Practical Wedding](http://www.apracticalwedding.com)'s budget guidance to my own wedding budget. Weddings are big events. Things will most likely come up. Your guest list might be higher than originally estimated, or maybe you forgot you have to tip some of your vendors. Regardless, you should build in a spending buffer of 10%. This will protect you in the case of emergencies or unexpected costs.
