## Put 10% Aside for Fun

Putting all your money towards responsible goals is great, but it often doesn't feel very fun. That's why it's a good idea to set 10 percent of that windfall aside just for you. When you make room for [indulgence](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/why-spending-money-on-happy-is-worth-it/), it's easier to be responsible with most of the money.
