## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about how you can prepare ahead of time for [holiday spending](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-plan-ahead-for-holiday-spending/). You don't have to be stressed and broke every year. Plan ahead and make your life better. 

## **What I’m Up To**

* Next month, [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) is meeting to talk about [how to ask for a raise](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-ask-for-a-raise/) at your current job. If you know you’ll have to do this soon, join us on October 24th!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I won an award last week! The DC Women's Business Center named me the Woman Empowerment Entrepreneur of the Year!
