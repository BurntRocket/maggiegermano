## What I’m Writing

This week’s topic was a little heavy, but important to talk about: **[money shame](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-cope-with-your-money-shame/)**. If you know you struggle with feeling ashamed about your financial situation, this post might be for you!

## What I’m Up To

* I was quoted in [Glam](https://www.glam.com/culture/heres-how-much-stay-at-home-moms-would-make-if-they-were-salaried/?fbclid=IwAR1pUFFGOhskW24Q2DAVu-dAZrpeIGQfoDROF0UWfZRAP2EOPykNU_-z1eI) this week about the value of domestic labor and the importance of an egalitarian split of those duties.

* On February 6th, I’ll be at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/money-matters-get-financially-savvy-in-2019/washington-dc/66002) again, talking about how to be financially savvy in 2019. 

* The [February Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-showing-your-love-on-a-budget-tickets-54758999642) meetup is on Wednesday, February 13th (which is also Galentine's Day). We'll be talking about how to show your love on a budget, especially if you love to give gifts. 

* On March 6th, I will be putting on a [values and money workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aligning-your-money-with-your-values-tickets-54778910195) at the [Lemon Collective](http://www.wearethelemoncollective.com/). 

* On March 12th, I will be leading a [Making & Breaking the Budget workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-tickets-55047193638) at [Mindspace](https://www.mindspace.me/).
