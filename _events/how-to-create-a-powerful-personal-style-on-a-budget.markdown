This Money Circle meetup is one that I'm personally very excited about. Do you find that you spend a bunch of money on clothes, but you're still not happy with your wardrobe? Do you wish you felt comfortable in your clothing every day, but you're not sure how to do that? Do you want to have a closet full of clothes that you love, but you're not sure how to do so on a budget? Well, this event is for you! We'll be joined by personal style coach, Allison Hamilton-Rohe.

Allison's 45-minute talk is designed to help you understand how the power of personal style can help you to improve your results and claim your dreams -- all without breaking the bank. She will walk us through how personal style can work for you and tell us how her unique formula makes it easy.

You'll learn:

* What growth mindset and personal style have in common

* Why what you wear can improve your outcomes

* How to create your own personal style

* When to invest in style and when to hold

* How less really is more

Join us for this talk to ensure your personal style is truly working for you!
