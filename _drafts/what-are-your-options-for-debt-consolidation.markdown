Do you have a bunch of different debts? Do you get overwhelmed by multiple monthly payments and growing interest fees? You're not alone.

As of December 2017, there was over $1 trillion in revolving debt in the United States. When divided by the number of adults who have credit cards, that averages out to over $5,000 of credit card debt per person. Some people have more, some people have less. But the fact is, many, many people are dealing with credit card debt in the United States.

All that said, having many different accounts to worry about, and having variable interest rates, can be a hinderance to paying down debt. In these situations, consolidating your debt can be a great way to simplify things and save money overtime. But it can be scary and confusing when looking into your options for consolidation. So I summarized for you.

## Personal Loan

One downside of this option is that there can be an origination fee for the loan. That means that you're charged a lump sum that equals a percentage of the loan you're taking out. Depending on the amount of the loan, that can be a big amount. It's a good practice to compare what you're paying in interest to what you'd be paying for the origination fee. Even better, look for a company that doesn't charge origination fees.

Another thing to look for is whether or not the loan provider charges penalties for paying off your loan early. 

## Balance Transfer

One downside of this option is that there is usually an origination fee for your balance transfer. That means that you are charged a lump sum that equals a small percentage of the debt you're transferring. Depending on the amount of debt, that sum can be a lot of money.

Make sure you don't add any new spending to the card you've transferred your balances to. You want to make sure you only need to pay back the amount you transferred, not any additional debt. It's also important to stop using the credit cards you already had. You don't want to get stuck in a pattern of transferring your debt over and over and never seeing the end.

## Home Equity Loan

## Borrowing from Retirement

I would consider this your absolutely last resort. You should leave your retirement savings alone at all costs.

A big downside is that if you left your employer for a new job, you'd have to pay back the amount you owe right away.

It's important to remember that debt consolidation does not mean your debt is going away. You still have to work to pay it down in its new form. And the most important thing to remember is that you must continue to be careful with your spending. It can be very easy to build up debt again after you've consolidated. If you tend to struggle with credit card debt, stop using your credit cards after you consolidate. Otherwise, you may find yourself in this situation again in a couple years.
