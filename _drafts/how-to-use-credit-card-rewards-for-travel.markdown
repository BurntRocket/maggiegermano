**Disclaimer:** While I fully take advantage of credit card rewards programs, credit cards are not for everyone. If you struggle with debt and overspending, you probably shouldn't sign up for rewards cards. The interest rates tend to be much higher, so if you can't pay off your card in full every month, you'll end up spending a lot more money in interest over time.

## Airline Miles

A few years ago, I used US Airways points to fly to the UK roundtrip. I only had to pay $106 for taxes and fees. Just last summer, I used American Airlines points to fly my boyfriend and me home from Spain for about $60.

## Hotel Points

I used the points I received from the Hilton Honors for a full week's stay in Denver for free.

## Travel Credit

The Barclaycard World Arrival credit card let's you use your points as a credit towards your travel spending. So if you have 12,500 points, you can get $125 applied to any travel spending on your credit card. For example, I used points to knock over $100 off of a car rental.
