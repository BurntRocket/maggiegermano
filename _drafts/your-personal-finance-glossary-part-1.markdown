April is Financial Literacy Month. It’s okay if you forgot, because I almost did too! The COVID-19 crisis has thrown us all for a loop. But I still want to help you move forward with your financial goals and get your money in order, especially during a global pandemic. That’s why, this month, I’ll be going back to my somewhat normal content, starting with a financial glossary.

One of the things that can be most frustrating is seeing lots of terms and words out there that you think might apply to you, but that you don’t actually understand.

**503B**

**Liquid Savings**

This term came up when I was texting with my sisters and two of my cousins. My one cousin was asking if she should be more aggressive while paying down her student loans and I asked her how much liquid savings she has. She said, "maybe that's a term you should add to your glossary", because she wasn't sure what it meant. 

Liquid savings is any money in a savings account that you have immediate access to. Any money in the stock market or even in a CD is not considered liquid. And that is due to a few things:

* The stock market is volatile, so your balance is likely to fluctuate over time. That means that you won't always have the same amount of money available to you.

* It can take several days to get money out of your stock market accounts and into your bank account.

* If you withdraw money from a CD before the term is over, you will get penalized with fees.

Liquid savings is money that you would keep in a savings account in a bank, preferably one with a high-yield interest rate and no monthly fees. This is the type of account that you should keep your emergency fund in. Any money that you rely on or will need at a moment's notice should be kept here.

Are there other financial words or terms that you wish you understood better? Send them to me and I’ll include them in my next glossary post! Share in the comments or send me an email at hello (at) maggiegermano (dot) com.
