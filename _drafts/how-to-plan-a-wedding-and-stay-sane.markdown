Get Your Partner Involved

I will never understand how one person in a couple can do all the wedding planning while the other person sits it out. Traditionally, we hear stories about the bride doing all the planning (and caring) and the groom just shows up on the wedding day. No thanks! 

My fiance, Dan, is super involved in our wedding planning. In fact, he wants to get way more hands-on with things than I do. (He's making out centerpiece vessels, he designed our save-the-dates, and he will be designing our invitations and ketubah.)
