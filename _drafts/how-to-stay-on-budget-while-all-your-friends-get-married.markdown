Have you gotten to a certain age when it feels like everyone you know is getting married? I've personally been through two phases of this. When I was 26, I went to eight weddings in one calendar year. This year, I'm 30 and I'll be attending four weddings; one of those is my own! These life events are wonderful and a lot of fun, but they can also cost a whole lot of money. So how can you celebrate your friends and family while not blowing your budget completely?

## Plan It Out

Find out when your friends and family members are getting married and mark it on your calendar. Figure out how much time you have to plan and save for the wedding. Next, find out if you’ll be invited to any pre-wedding parties, like a bridal shower or bachelorette party. Put those on your calendar as well, so that they’re always on your radar.

## Prioritize Events

There are lots of events when it comes to weddings. Engagement parties, bridal showers, bachelorette parties, rehearsal dinners, and then the wedding itself! If travel is involved, these can really add up. So start prioritizing; you don’t have to go to every single event if it doesn’t fit in your budget. You also don’t have to go to every wedding you’re invited to. It can be awkward to send a “no” RSVP, but if that’s what’s best for you, do it.

## Create a Wedding Guest Budget

Decide how many wedding events you’ll be going to. Figure out how much it will cost to attend them. Make sure to include travel costs, hotel stays, gifts, clothing, etc. From there, calculate how much money you would have to save each month to have the amount you need when the wedding date comes. If you don’t think you could possibly save that much money each month, what do you need to do instead? Are there events you can skip? Can you take on a side hustle to bring in extra income?

## Start Saving

Set up a savings account that is specifically for wedding expenses. This will make it easier to keep track of how much you’re saving. It is also an easy place to pull the money from once you need it. From there, start saving money every month.

## Do Group Gifts

If you and your friends are traveling for a wedding, consider going in on a gift together, rather than everyone buying something separately. This can save money, but it can also allow you to get your friend something meaningful that you wouldn’t have been able to afford otherwise.
