## What I’m Writing

* On my blog this week, I wrote about how to deal with [being jealous](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-deal-when-youre-jealous-of-your-friends-finances/) of your friends' financial situations. 

* Over at my [Women@Forbes column](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/), I wrote about [how to avoid lifestyle inflation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2018/08/29/how-to-avoid-unnecessary-income-creep/) as you earn more money throughout your career. If you haven't already, follow my column so that you'll always know when I publish a new piece!
