*This is part three for June's theme of money and how it relates to our loved ones. Check out part [one](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/financially_prepare_for_family_occasions/) and [two](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-stop-trying-to-keep-up-with-the-joneses/)!*

I bet you talk more openly with your friends about your sex life than your money life. Am I right? Somehow it's more comfortable to discuss what's happening between the sheets than what's happening in our bank accounts. I really believe it's time to change that! Why? If we could learn how to talk about money with our friends, we would all be a lot better off.

We'd feel less embarrassed about spending less at the bar, or staying in more often.  Our friends would know our financial goals, and we would feel more supported. We'd also feel less alone. I hear so often that people think they're the only ones struggling with money, that they just "don't have it together". If we talked to our friends about our money issues, we could see that they might be struggling with the same things. It builds community, compassion, and understanding. And you might even get an accountability buddy!

So let's start the conversation. Here are some tips for how to approach the money convo with your friends.

## Be honest

It might go without saying in this article, but you need to actually talk to your friends about money. In the past, I would say no to plans or bail at the last minute because I couldn't or didn't want to spend the money. But I wouldn't tell my friends *why* I was canceling, I would just cancel. I ended up feeling isolated, and I pissed off some of my friends. If you're honest about what your limitations are,

## Be vulnerable

At [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) last week, one attendee said, "the only way to counter shame is vulnerability". (Thanks, [Brené Brown](http://brenebrown.com/)!) It's true. Money brings up a lot of shame, especially in women. But the only way to deal with that shame, and hopefully step out of it, is to be honest about our experiences.

## Talk about your goals

I've talked about this before, but just saying "I'm broke" probably isn't a very compelling excuse to your friends. However, if you let them in on your long term goals, they will probably be more supportive. This might involve getting pretty vulnerable, like I mentioned above, but it will pay off in the long run.

## Ask about their goals

I mentioned this in my piece about having the [money talk](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/have-the-money-talk) with your romantic partner, but it works just as well with friends.
