It's almost Valentine's Day! That means you're being inundated with ads from companies that sell diamonds, flowers, chocolates, and more. It also means you're probably feeling pressured or tempted to buy something for a loved one that you may or may not be able to afford. Plus, as I wrote about at the holidays, maybe you or your loved ones don't really want to give or receive physical gifts.

## Make a Meal

## Bake Cookies

## Write a Card

## Frame a Photo
