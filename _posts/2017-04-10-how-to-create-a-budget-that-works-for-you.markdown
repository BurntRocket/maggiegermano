Happy Financial Literacy Month! This week, I want to talk to you about creating a budget that works for you. Just like with healthy eating and exercise habits, it's really hard to stick to a budget. That's usually because we are trying to stick to a budget that doesn't make sense for us. So let's figure out how you can create a budget that will help you to be financially successful.

## Identify your financial goals

It'll be a lot easier to stick to a budget if you know what you're doing it for. Sticking to a budget for budget's sake is a recipe for failure. That's why you need to identify your goals so that you can see what you're working towards. You'll feel a lot more motivated that way.

What is most important to you moving forward? Do you want to make changes in your career, love life, friendships or financial situation? Do you want to travel? Pick out the goals that mean the most to you, and then you can figure out how to achieve them.

Make sure you write those goals down - you’re much more likely to reach them that way. If these goals are big, break them down into digestible steps. This will make it much less intimidating, and also feel more attainable. For example, if you want to save $5,000 in a travel fund by 2018, figure out how much you'd have to save each week to make that happen.

Now that you know your goals, you can build your budget to help you reach them.

## Figure out how much is coming in

Some of us don't even know how much our monthly income is. We get our direct deposit and go on with our day. But it's really important to know exactly how much is coming in each month. Look at your past four paychecks. Are they consistent? What's being taken out of them besides taxes?

## Figure out how much is going out

Look at all of your expenses. These are broken out into fixed costs, flex spending, and

To make this easier, link up your accounts to programs like Learnvest, Personal Capital or Mint. These will automatically categorize your spending into different buckets, so you can see where you are using most of your money.

## Automate

The easiest way to save is to set it and forget it. Set up direct deposit from your paycheck, or have your bank make scheduled transfers. This way, you don’t have to think about it and you won’t miss the money. You’re way more likely to save when you do this.

If you are working to pay down your debt, set up auto pay or set a reminder for yourself each month. You want to make sure to pay your bills on time
