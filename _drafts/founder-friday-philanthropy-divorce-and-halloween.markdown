## **What I’m Up To**

* I released tickets for the [November Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/saving-all-year-for-big-expenses-tickets-77401711603) meetup! We’ll be talking about how to plan and save all year so that we can afford big expenses. Hope to see you on November 20th!

* I’m doing some thinking about what topics I want to cover in upcoming Money Circle meetups in Washington, DC. Send your preferences in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9h1xvbIg9UctjkOCfY7hWgAz5O1lOn07xX6ztEyiE3r96Uw/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

* I’ve created a virtual [Money Circle membership program](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)! If you are not located in the DC area, or if you just want more connection through Money Circle, this program is for you. There are 3 tiers that offer different options at different price points. There is a group coaching component and even a level that lets you check in with me every month. [Sign up today!](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)
