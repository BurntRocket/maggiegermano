## A safe place to talk about money challenges.

There’s so much shame surrounding money, especially for women. We don't get taught about personal finance in school, but then we are embarrassed and ashamed when we grow up and don't know how to manage our money. Student loan debt and credit card debt are at an all time high, but we are told that everything would be fine if we just stopped buying coffee. The gender and wage gap still persist, but women and people of color are told that they just need to negotiate more. To make things even worse, most people aren't talking about their financial struggles, so we feel like we're all alone.

If you relate to the issues above, you probably don’t know where to turn for money advice and resources and you don’t feel comfortable talking about it to family and friends. You’re longing for a place where you can find nonjudgmental support that helps you find the motivation to change your financial situation for the better.  This is true whether you want to learn how to budget once and for all, or you're struggling with credit card debt, or you're buried in student loan debt, or you want to someday own a home of your very own.

The Money Circle Community is that safe space where you can talk about your finances without fear of judgment. It's a place to connect with people who have been in your shoes and people who are in your shoes. It's a place to get resources and support from people who understand you, but who don't have a personal stake in your financial decisions.

In this safe, intersectional feminist space, we will break down money shame and build community and safety for everyone, so that you can find the support you need to gain control over your finances.
