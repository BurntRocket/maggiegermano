In the last several months, I've thought a lot about estate planning and life insurance. I wrote on my [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2019/02/15/despite-their-priorities-nearly-half-of-americans-over-55-still-dont-have-a-will/) column about why it's so important to have a will. My husband and I bought our own life insurance. I found out how expensive funerals are in the United States. Basically, I've been thinking a lot about death. Perhaps that sounds morbid, but it's something that literally all of us have to face eventually. Pretending it won't happen won't help us or prevent us from dying someday. So,

## You'll Have Peace of Mind

Life insurance is just like many other types of insurance. You get it in order to prepare for the worst, while hoping the worst never happens.

## You'll Take Care of Your Loved Ones

Have you ever heard stories about someone's parent dying and their family being left with not only their grief, but debt as well? It happens a lot and it can add a large burden

## You'll Plan for Your Future

One of the most important differences between whole and term life insurance is the investment component. Whole life insurance will last you for your entire life (rather than a specific 20 or 30 year term like with term insurance).

My husband and I decided for now to have term life insurance. It's more affordable for our current financial situation, and it's possible to switch to whole life insurance without penalty. Of course, the premiums will go up, but we don't have to get another health exam or anything like that. We haven't decided yet if we actually will switch to whole life insurance, but it's an appealing option that would give us access to more funds later in life.
