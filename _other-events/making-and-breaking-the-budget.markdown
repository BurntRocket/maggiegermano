Do you struggle with managing your money on a day-to-day basis? You're absolutely not alone. And chances are, you never actually learned how to create a budget and live within your means. That doesn't make you a bad person, it doesn't make you irresponsible, and it doesn't mean you will never be able to get control over your money. Come to the Making & Breaking The Budget workshop to learn how to get started so you can move forward with confidence!

Creating a budget means you have a starting place for your money. A budget is a best-case scenario for how you want to use your money. It helps you identify where you can and must make changes. You won't always be perfect, and you won't always stick to your budget, but that doesn't mean you should abandon it all together. In fact, you need to have a basic budget so that you know what you're working with and where to go from there.

At this interactive workshop, you'll:

* Get clear on your numbers (what's coming in and what's going out)

* Figure out what you value most (and therefore where your money should be going)

* Learn about the "one number" budgeting system

* Get ideas for what kind of budgeting system might work for you

* Decide how specific and strict you want your budget to be

* Walk away with a starter budget that you can tweak as you use it

* Feel confident that you can make budgeting decisions that work

See you there?
