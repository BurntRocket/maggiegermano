Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was (and still am) up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/) was this week! I do technically count the sales for this monthly event as income, but the money that comes in usually just covers what I spend on snacks and wine.

* This money hasn't actually come in yet, but I'm speaking at [Roger Morris University](http://www.rmu.edu) tomorrow. They'll be paying me via check when I arrive.

* One of my new clients' monthly payments came through this week.

* I got two new monthly clients this week! This was actually really exciting. I've been taking a sales course ([check it out here!](https://www.smartgetspaid.com/signed/)) and I used some of the advice in my discovery calls this week. The approach clearly works because both people signed on for coaching while we were still on the phone! 

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* As I mentioned above, [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) was on Tuesday. I spent money on snacks and wine, and I also bought a "thank you" card and small gift for our guest expert, Liz Delgado-Steo.

* We were charged for the Hungry Harvest delivery we received last week. For $22.50, we received a dozen eggs, two bunches of kale, two zucchini, one cucumber, one bunch of small carrots, two bags of snap peas, and one eggplant. It's a pretty good deal, especially considering that we are also saving the food from being thrown in the trash.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about what to do with the money if you get a windfall. A windfall is when you receive an unexpected sum of money. It's important to take a beat and make smart decisions with that money. [Check it out!](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-to-do-if-you-get-a-windfall/)

## **What I’m Up To**

* I’m holding my first official workshop! On Saturday, September 15th, we’ll be gathering at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/) in Petworth, DC to learn how to budget! Sign up for the [Making & Breaking the Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) workshop today!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I’m speaking at [Robert Morris University](https://www.rmu.edu/) tomorrow! In fact, I'm on my way to Pittsburgh right now, and I'm pumped to explore a new city. If you have any places that you think I must check out, comment below! I’m hoping to do more events like this, because it’s important to get your money right from a young age, and I want to reach women in college! So if you know of any universities who are looking for money experts, [let me know](mailto:boss@maggiegermano.com).

* I spoke to the great folks at ISL on Wednesday. I love speaking to smaller groups, because it's really easy to ask people's specific questions.

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

![When you get a sum of money that you weren't expecting or planning on, don't spend it right away. Take a step back and analyze where that money needs to go.

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
