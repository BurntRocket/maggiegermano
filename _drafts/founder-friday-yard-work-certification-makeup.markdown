## How I Earned Money This Week

## How I Spent Money This Week

* This was another rough week on the homeowner side of things. On Monday and Tuesday, we had a ton of insulation installed in the attic, closets, and basement. We had an energy audit done a couple months ago and it found that our house was pretty inefficient, which we definitely could feel all winter. In preparation for the hot summer, we had insulation put in, which will hopefully keep us more comfortable and keep our energy costs down. Luckily, we're getting a nice rebate from Pepco for doing energy upgrades, but it was still a big expense to pull from savings. I'm hoping it's worth it. 

* In addition to that, we had pre-emptive termite treatment done around the perimeter of our house. To prepare, we had to hire a junk hauling company to come and remove all of the construction materials the former owners left stored under our front porch. Since we already had the guys coming over, we had them take a massive pile of yard waste we'd collected after doing quite a bit of work cleaning things up in our back yard.

* On Tuesday, I applied to become certified by the [International Coach Federation](https://coachfederation.org/) (ICF). I'm already a Certified Professional Diversity Coach with [CoachDiversity Institute](http://coachdiversity.com/), but ICF is internationally recognized as the organization that officially certifies coaches. It's an expensive fee to apply for certification, but I have all the qualifications, and I'm hoping this puts me ahead of the curve when it comes to the coaching industry and the regulations that are sure to come eventually.

## What I’m Excited About

* Tonight is the [Being Boss book launch party](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/being-boss-dc-book-launch-party-tickets-43800308903) in DC! I'm sponsoring the event, along with a bunch of other fantastic businesses and individuals. I've been listening to the Being Boss podcast since I first started my business 2 years ago, and I can't wait to dig into the book. 

* I tried Zumba for the first time this week.
