  ## Workshops

  Maggie is able to tailor workshops to your specific needs, but some existing workshops are:

  ### Get Your Money Right
  Want to get your money right but you're not sure where to start? In this workshop, Maggie will tell you what you need to do from start to finish to get control of your money. This workshop is designed for those who are just starting out, so it is easy to comprehend, with tangible next steps to take away.

  ### Values and Money
  Budgeting and managing your money is a lot easier when you feel emotionally connected to it. That's why it's important to align your values with your financial goals. This workshop will show you how to identify your values and figure out how to create financial goals that align with them.

  ### Confidence and Money
  Something that holds women back from getting their money right is the feeling that they don't know what they're doing. This workshop will show you how to find confidence with your money and make the changes that you're hoping for.

  ### Making and Breaking the Budget
  Budgeting is hard. We need a new way to approach it, and that means creating a budget that works for you and your life, goals, and values. This workshop will help you identify your values, determine your goals, and create a budget that you'll actually want to stick to.
