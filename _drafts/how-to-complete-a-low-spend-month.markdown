New year, new budget. Do you want to take control of your money this year? Start off strong by doing a low-spend January! I’m sure you’ve heard of Dry January, where you commit to not drinking any alcohol for 30 days. Well, there are also “no-spend” months, but I prefer to call them “low-spend” months, because it’s impossible to spend NO money at all.

What does a low-spend month look like? You only spend money on the necessities: rent, utilities, transportation, subscriptions, loans, groceries, etc. Anything that is not essential or required, like going out to eat or going shopping, is not allowed.

What is the point of this exercise? Not only will it help you spend much less this month (and hopefully you'll put that extra cash into savings or toward debt), but it will also show you what you really don’t need to be spending money on. It will also show you that you’re capable of cutting back on spending if you put your mind to it.

So how does it work?

## Make a list of all the essentials that you must pay for

## Make a list of all the non-essentials that you will be giving up

## Check in at least once a week to see how you’re doing

## Write down how you’re feeling about the challenge

## Make a list of what was easy to give up and what was hard

At the end of this, you’ll have a good idea of what you can go without from now on! You’ll see that it’s actually possible to cut your spending if you put your mind to it.
