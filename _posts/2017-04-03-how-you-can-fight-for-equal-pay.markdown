Equal Pay Day is tomorrow, April 4th. Equal Pay Day is the symbolic day when the average American woman's earnings "catches up" to white men's earning from the previous year. Isn't it crazy to think that it takes women (on average) an extra three months to earn as much as a man did last year, for the same work? I want to use this day to show you how you can work to close the wage gap in your own life.

Last year, I was in a salary negotiation workshop given by [AAUW](https://salary.aauw.org/) and that is when I decided to pursue my business as a financial coach. I went on to be trained as a facilitator for that same workshop, and I am still passionate about empowering women to negotiate.

Before going into how to negotiate, I want to give you a little more context about the wage gap in the U.S.

## The low-down on the wage gap

* Women earn (on average) 80 cents on the dollar compared to a white man.

* Black women earn... 

* Latina women earn...

* And Native American women only earn...
