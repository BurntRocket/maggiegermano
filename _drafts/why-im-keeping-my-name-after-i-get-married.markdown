**Disclaimer:** *This article is going to be super heteronormative. I’m speaking about my own experience, and based on the research that has been conducted so far. Unfortunately, much of the research has only focused on heterosexual (white?) couples. I will include some stats about gay couples, but most of this article will focus on my thoughts on heterosexual marriage, as that’s what I’m about to enter into! I’d love to hear your experience as someone in a same-sex marriage (or otherwise), so please do share in the comments!*

Eighty to ninety percent of heterosexual American women take their husband's last name after they get married. Only three percent of men take their wife’s last name. In a [2011 study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243211398653), seventy-two percent of respondents said they believe women *should* take their husband's last name. Half of those people said they think it should be legally required for women to do so!

I would love to say that I don't hold any judgment for women who do change their names, but I am still a human. I believe that women should make whatever choice they feel best about, and if that means changing their name, go for it! But I'd be lying if I said I didn't bristle a little bit every time a friend changes their name on Facebook the day after their wedding. This is not because I'm against the idea of having one name for a family, it's because women are the only ones who are expected to do so. Yes, there are some guys out there who will take their wife's name, but that's still incredibly uncommon. I would feel so much better if it was more of a real conversation, but we aren't there yet.

The history of a woman taking her husband’s name.

## What I feel like I’d be losing:

* **My identity:** I've been Maggie Germano for my entire life. I would be giving up a big part of myself if I gave up my name for a new one.

* **My connection with my family:** This reason is slightly hypocritical because one of my arguments against changing my name is that everyone in a family doesn't have to have the same name to be considered a family. But I do identify strongly as a "Germano" and want to stay that way.

* **My principles:** My main issue with the name change question is that men don't have to answer it. 

* **My domain name and business recognition:** When I started my business, I decided to name it after myself because I knew my name would never change. I didn't want to come up with a cutesy business name and then change it later when I grew out of it. If I changed my name now, I would have to change my business name, all my materials, and my domain name. 

I honestly don’t know what we’ll do with our kids’ names. We’ve been talking about that a lot lately, and haven’t come to a real agreement. In fact, it's been a point of contention, because we both have the same arguments for our kids having either of our last names. I do think it’s unfair that a woman is not present in her children’s identity (name). We give birth, we are still the primary caregiver. We are just as much an influential parent as a father may be. Why can’t our children carry our names?

I’m not keen on a hyphenated name (Germano-Rader or Rader-Germano). The idea of using our couple name (Radermano) seems perfect and adorable but also isn’t actually a name (but what’s in a name? Aren’t they all made up?). Dan has suggested that we use my last name as our kids’ middle names but that isn’t super appealing to me either.

## The cost/inconvenience of changing your name:

A piece of this puzzle that isn't always talked about is the literal cost of changing your name. There are a lot of documents to change and processes to go through to make that happen. Most of those things cost time and money, and women are the ones paying it. 

* **Social security card:** This is the first step you should take, since you'll need an updated social security card in order to update other items. You'll need to provide your birth certificate, marriage license, and other identification in order to go through this process. This step costs nothing, but you will have to go into the Social Security Administration office to do it.

* **State-issued identification:** Once you update your social security card, you can go to the DMV to update your license or other ID. To see how the process works in your state, Google "how to change my name on my \[state name\] license". 

* **Passport:** If you're changing your name and you also enjoy to travel, you'll need to get a new passport. This process can cost between [$0 and $165](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/fees.html), depending on your situation and needs. You'll need to provide proof of citizenship, your marriage license, and possibly another form of photo ID. \*Be careful! If you've already booked a flight in your maiden name, wait to legally change your name until after the trip, or else TSA and Customs will give you a really hard time!\*

* **Bank accounts:** x

* **Email address:** x

* **All online accounts:** x

* **Website domain:** If you have your own business or other type of

Ultimately, it's up to the individual whether or not they want to change their name. And I'm trying to be less reactionary when I see my friends change their names on Facebook. However, I do hope that one day men and women change their names at an equal rate, rather than it being a given that women will do it. But until then,
