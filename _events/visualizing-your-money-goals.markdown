It's fairly easy to think about, talk about, and write about goals. But when it comes to maintaining motivation while working towards those goals, that's where it gets tricky. This is especially true when it comes to financial goals because it's easy to forget about them or ignore them as life gets in the way.

This is why it's so important to have a visual reminder of our goals! That way, we can track our progress towards our goals AND get a daily reminder of what we're working towards. Plus, visualizing our goals can make them clearer and therefore easier to plan for. Think about it as financial vision boarding.

Join us at the June Money Circle meetup to create visual representations of your money goals! If you don't know what those goals are just yet, join us anyway! Hearing about other people's goals might inspire you.

I'll provide some paper and markers, but if there is anything else that helps you to get creative (magazines, glitter, etc), please bring it along!
