Happy Friday!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had one Airbnb guest this week.

* One of my ongoing clients signed on for another 3 months.

* I had two couples sign up for one-time coaching sessions. 

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Our annual Amazon Prime membership fee went through on Monday. Hate getting surprised by bills like these? Set up an account for [non-monthly expenses](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/prepare-for-non-monthly-expenses) and save throughout the year!

* We were too tired to get groceries earlier this week so we got dinner at Whole Foods' hot bar. Vegan General Tso's FTW.

* Dan put up our beautiful [new light fixture](https://www.wayfair.com/lighting/pdp/trent-austin-design-3-light-kitchen-island-pendant-tadn1746.html) in our kitchen! So we ordered some [fake Edison bulbs](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XTG6LTZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (they're LED) to put in it. We also order some ant poison for our basement (yay, spring) and a few other items for the house.

* I got a massage yesterday. It was way overdue and definitely needed. It's hard to validate spending money on something like this, especially since my income is currently a lot lower than it used to be. However, I built up a nice fun fund last year and this is the exact type of expense it's for. So I pulled that money from my savings and got an amazing massage from Layne at Aura Spa on U Street.

## **What I’m Excited About**

* Dan's family is coming to town today to celebrate Passover with us and see our new house. We were in Syracuse last weekend with my family for Easter, so it's nice to host Passover, even if we're a bit late.

* I was on the [Aligned and Alive](http://alliowen.com/maggie/) podcast this week with Alli Owen! We talked about all things money and women and it turned out really well!
