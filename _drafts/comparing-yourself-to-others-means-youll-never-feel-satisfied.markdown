Have you ever heard the saying "comparison is the thief of joy"? I've found it to be incredibly true in my own life. The idea is that if you always compare yourself or your circumstances to others, you'll never be happy. It will always seem like someone else is more beautiful, more successful, more popular, and more wealthy than you are.

Recently, I was interviewed by *[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/who-feels-rich/594439/)* for a piece about money satisfaction. The reporter asked me why I think some people are unhappy about their money no matter how much they earn. My first response was that most people start spending more as they earn more, so they stay in the same paycheck-to-paycheck situation. But secondly, I think a lot of people are unsatisfied because they are continuously comparing themselves to other people. These could be loved ones or strangers on the internet. The outcome is the same: they think they everyone is better off than they are, especially when it comes to money.

I hear this a lot. And I'm not immune to it either! Social media makes it a thousand times easier to look at others and envy them and then put ourselves down. But doing this won't make us feel any better about our own lives, so we need to start doing certain things to get into a better place.

## Remember That Not Everything Is As It Seems

Have you ever heard that social media is just everyone's highlight reel? I think that's really true. And it's often true even when we are catching up with friends in person. It means that we are only posting and reporting on the positive things that are happening in our lives. 

## Limit Your Social Media Time

As I said above, we tend to only share our highlight reel on social media. We're much more likely to show pictures of our fantastic vacation than we are to post about the debt we went into for it. 

## Ask and Tell Your Friends The Truth

Much of the time, when we're jealous of someone else, it turns out that their life isn't as perfect as we think it is. In fact, there's no such thing as a perfect life!

## Practice Gratitude For What You Already Have

When we are feeling envious of what everyone else has that we don't, it can be easy to forget what it is that we actually* do *have. 

## Get Clear On What You Really Want

A lot of my clients feel jealous or ashamed when they see their friends buying homes.
