Recently, I've been reflecting upon the past year and making plans for this year. And I've obviously been encouraging you to do the same. One of the things that comes up a lot for my clients and readers is that their big goal is to get out of debt. But sometimes, it can feel impossible to do it. Many of you don't know where to start or which strategies to employ. And when you don't know where to start, it feels too overwhelming to do anything. So this week, I'm writing about the steps you need to take to pay down your credit card debt.
