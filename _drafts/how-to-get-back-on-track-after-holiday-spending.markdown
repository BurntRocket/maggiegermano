Happy holidays, y'all! As of today, we are two days away from Christmas and a day into Hanukkah. That means that we're SO close to being done with holiday season. And hopefully most of you have finished all of your holiday shopping by now. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the holiday season, especially now that I have my own house to decorate. But there's a lot of pressure around spending money this season, and it can be really overwhelming. You probably don't want to think more about money right now, but right now is actually a great time to work on getting back on track!
