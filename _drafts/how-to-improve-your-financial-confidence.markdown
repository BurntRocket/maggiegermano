- How Money Can Help Me Feel How I Want to Feel

Nearly four years ago, when I was just realizing that I wanted to pursue the financial industry for my career, I faced a fork in the road. Do I go to school to become a Certified Financial Planner and help people with their investments? Or do I get certified as a coach and help people with the daily financial struggles that come with life? I decided to take the coaching road mainly because I want to help the people who are not yet ready to invest their money, or those who are already contributing to retirement but who are still living paycheck to paycheck every month. Those people are the ones who aren't getting the support that they need from the financial industry and I aim to help them. But on top of that, I was also passionate and excited about the emotional side of money. I knew that in order to make long-term, positive change, my clients would need to work on themselves and their own financial beliefs. I've been on that path ever since.

## Why Financial Confidence Matters

Your relationship with money will impact how you behave with your money. That means that the more confident you feel about managing your money, the better you'll do so. Here are some things I know for sure:

* Emotions play a much bigger role in money than you might think.

* Our family history impacts how we behave with money.

* The way we think about money determines how we will act with our money.

* Sometimes, we’re the ones holding ourselves back.

* If you don’t think you can do it, you won’t try to do it.

* If you think you’ll always be “bad” with money, you’ll keep making the same bad decisions.

* Many of us don’t ask for what we want because we don’t believe we deserve it.

* Many of us get stuck in the cycle of debt because we don’t think we deserve better.

* We feel isolated from others because we think we are alone in our financial struggles.
