Tomorrow's the day! (But Happy [Galentine's Day](https://www.bustle.com/articles/141646-what-is-galentines-day-leslie-knopes-favorite-holiday-is-something-we-should-all-celebrate), if you're celebrating!)

I'm sure you've been inundated since January with Valentine's Day sales and gimmicks. Many of us don't like the pressure that Valentine's Day brings; it's a Hallmark holiday that forces us to spend money in order to prove that we love someone.

I've always enjoyed these types of holidays, though. In school, I would wear all red or pink, with a heart sticker somewhere on my body. I loved giving out Valentine's Day cards to my friends and family. As I got older, I liked spending the evening with my girlfriends, eating chocolate and watching bad movies. Now that I have a partner, the day is a little different, but it doesn't have to be stressful. I look at it as a nice reminder to tell people that you love them. So, whether you you'll spend the day with a friend, lover, or family member, don't forget that you don't have to go broke.

## 1. Cook dinner at home

You don't have to eat at a fancy restaurant to have a romantic evening. Last year, my boyfriend made filet mignon ($15 for two filets at Trader Joe's!) with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. We paired it with some decent (inexpensive) wine and voila! For dessert, we made [chocolate lava cakes](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/molten-lava-cakes-recipe.html) from scratch. I still dream about them...

## 2. Go to (or host!) a low-cost event

Find out what is going on in your area. Is there a [local paper](http://local.washingtoncitypaper.com/tag-family/see-and-do-categories) that outlines everything that is happening in your city? The [Kennedy Center](https://m.kennedy-center.org/home/mscalendar/) has free concerts all the time. There are plenty of free or cheap museum and art exhibits. If you don't feel like going out, have people over! Host a pot luck or movie night. I find that hanging out at someone's house is always more fun, since you don't have to worry about money, and you can drink as much as you want.

## 3. Go outside

If it's not too cold out, spend time in nature! Go for a walk or a hike.

## 4. Agree on low-cost gifts (or none at all)

A gift for gift's sake isn't always the best idea. We often end up with a trinket we didn't really want that we don't value. If you don't have any good ideas for a low-cost gift, consider not getting each other gifts at all! Take some of the pressure off of your relationship. This year, I only asked for candy. If you do want to get something for your buddy or honey, [here](https://www.buzzfeed.com/anamariaglavan/valentines-day-gifts-for-under-25?utm_term=.jkP2ww97RK#.jc56KKZ5yg) are some cute [ideas](https://www.buzzfeed.com/maitlandquitmeyer/valentines-day-gifts-that-only-look-expensive-24-gifts-fo?utm_term=.epRr55bRxJ#.gaqxdd8v3W).
