Do you ever create and write down affirmations in order to change your mindset? I do it sometimes. And I often recommend positive affirmations to my financial coaching clients. A few weeks ago, I interviewed life coach [Cristina Roman](https://piquecoaching.co/) for the [Money Circle podcast](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/) (keep an eye out for her episode in the future!). Affirmations weren't the main focus of our conversation, but they did come up. And something really poignant that Cristina said was that affirmations won't be very useful if the person using them doesn't believe in what they say. If they are so beyond what you believe to be true, then they are pointless. That's why it's so important to create affirmations that you can actually believe in. Here's how you can do that with your money affirmations:

## Start Small

## Use Language You Believe

x

## Be Incremental

x

## Use Positive Language

x

## Remind Yourself
