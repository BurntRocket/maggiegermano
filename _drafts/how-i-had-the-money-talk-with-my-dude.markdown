One of the first articles I ever wrote about money was about how to have the money talk with your romantic partner. 

## I Started Early

I remember the moment I first talked to Dan about money. It was probably our fourth or fifth date and we were walking towards my apartment, where I was going to make dinner for him. Dan was carrying a bouquet of flowers for me. I turned to him and casually asked him if he had any credit card debt.

## I Communicated My Needs

When Dan and I first started dating, we obviously went out a lot. We went out for dinner, we went to movies, we went out to brunch, etc. At first, Dan paid for me much of the time, but once I found out how much he was earning in salary, I didn't feel comfortable letting him cover everything (we were making similar income and it wasn't a lot!).
