Have you ever felt like the only way to get your money right is to become a hermit and just have no social life whatsoever? I've been there too! When I first moved into my own apartment and was living alone, I knew I needed to be really careful with my money. My rent had nearly doubled and my student loan payments had increased. So there wasn't a lot of extra money to go around. My response to that was to almost completely obliterate my social life. I turned down most social requests and spent a lot of time alone in my apartment. Of course, this helped me to build up a substantial emergency fund and pay off my student loans four years early. But looking back, I think I went to an extreme when trying to cut my spending. I believe it's possible to be social while also sticking to a budget, even if it's a strict one.

However, sometimes our friends and social lives actually do harm our finances. But there are also ways that you can react to prevent that from happening.

## Judging Our Choices

Last week, during our [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) meetup, one of the attendees told the rest of us about an experience she'd recently had with a friend. She told that friend that she didn't think she'd ever want to own a home, and the friend, who'd recently bought her own home, thought she was crazy. The conversation escalated to the point where she felt judged and silenced by her friend. I'm sure everyone reading this has been in a similar situation where they felt judged for wha they choose to do or not to do in their lives.

**What you can do about it:** Try to understand that in this scenario, your loved ones are probably projecting their own issues onto you. In my friend's case, perhaps the friend was feeling insecure or overwhelmed about buying a home, and wanted to validate their own choice.
