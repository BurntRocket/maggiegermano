An [emergency fund](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/you-need-an-emergency-fund) is one of the most important financial accounts you can have. It is there for you during the worst times in your life. It protects you from things like eviction, default

However, it's one thing to build your emergency fund, and it's another thing to leave it alone. The point of an emergency fund is to use it for emergencies. If you use it for other things, like vacation or shopping, you'll run out of money and it won't be there when you actually need it.
