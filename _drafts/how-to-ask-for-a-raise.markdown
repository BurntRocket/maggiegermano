*Welcome to part 4 of Julyâ€™s theme of getting the most out of your career! If you haven't yet, check out parts [one](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/non-salary-perks-you-should-ask-for/), [two](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-pick-a-salary-number-that-works-for-you/), and [three](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-know-if-a-job-is-right-for-you/).*

Okay, so you now know how to figure out how much money you want to earn, but do you know how to ask for it? This can be especially hard when you're already employed and you want to ask for a raise. If you love your job, but you know you deserve to be earning more, it's important to ask for it.

## Track your accomplishments

This is SO important! Keep track of every project you work on, each success you have, every email of praise.

And if you don't get the raise or promotion that you want, you now have a fantastic list of things to add to your resume. (hint, hint)

## Do your research

Do you have an inkling that you might be underpaid? Perhaps you didn't negotiate your pay when you started the job. Or maybe you've been in your position for several years and have only gotten cost of living pay increases. If this is the case, you're not out of luck! Start researching how much someone in your position, with your experience, should be earning. Go to Glassdoor.com and Salary.com. Ask colleagues and mentors about their salary expectations.

## Find out about performance reviews

At many organizations, the performance review process is unclear or even nonexistent. So your first step is to find out if there is a structured process in place. If there is, find out when it happens, and if there is a general rule for when people get raises and promotions throughout the year. For example, at my company, performance reviews happen at the end of the fiscal year. At this time, we all get a cost-of-living increase, but we may also get a larger raise or promotion. Promotions also sometimes happen in January, at the mid-point of the fiscal year. At any other time of year, you're unlikely to get a change in pay or position.

Some places are less structured, and may do reviews more randomly. However
