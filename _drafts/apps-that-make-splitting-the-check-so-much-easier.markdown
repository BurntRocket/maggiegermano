## Splitwise

I had heard a lot about Splitwise from clients who use it with romantic partners or roommates, but I hadn't used it myself until this past March. I was up in Vermont for my friend Nina's bachelorette party and we were all perusing a cute wine and cheese shop. One of the other women suggested that she just pay for all of the wine and cheese (which added up to over $200) and then we could pay her back through Splitwise.

## Venmo

Venmo is a cash sharing app, not an app that splits your check or other expenses. But it's a really easy way to pay someone back for something! Plus, it often connects to the apps listed above and is the way you actually make the payment.
