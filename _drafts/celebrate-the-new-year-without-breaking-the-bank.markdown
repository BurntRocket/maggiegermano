Merry Christmas, if you're celebrating today! I hope you're spending the day with people you love, or indulging in some much-needed alone time. I love taking advantage of the holiday season to eat lots of cookies and sit under lots of blankets. Next weekend, once you've wound down from the holidays, it'll be time to ring in the new year. If you plan on celebrating, there are ways you can do so without breaking the bank.

## Use Cash Only

The best way to limit your spending is to make it impossible to spend more than you've budgeted for. The easiest way to do this is to leave your credit and debit cards home. Set a budget for your evening celebration. What's a number that will allow you to have fun without going over budget? Take that amount out of the bank in cash and only bring that with you on New Year's Eve.

## Eat Before You Go

If you're going out to a bar or party for New Year's Eve, a great way to save money is to eat before you get there. Make yourself dinner at home so you're not tempted to order food once you're out. Plus, you won't get as drunk as you would if you don't eat.

## Host a Party (or Brunch)

My fiance and I are hosting a New Year's Day brunch this year. We're not as interested in going out on New Year's Eve anymore, but we still want to celebrate. So we're having friends over to our new house and hosting a potluck brunch. There will be plenty of champagne flowing, but we'll likely be spending less than we would out at a bar.

So if you want to be with the people you love, but don't necessarily want to go out or spend a bunch of money at a restaurant or bar, throw your own party! Have your guests bring a drink or dish to pass and everyone will have plenty to imbibe without spending very much.
