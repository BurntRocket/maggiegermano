First, I want to say to my Black readers and friends, I see you. I stand with you. I do not ask you to educate me, as it's my responsibility to do so myself, but if there is any way I can be helpful or supportive, please do let me know.

To my white readers and friends, we need to do better. It’s normal to feel uncomfortable when you’re forced to question a system that exists for you. It’s normal to feel uncomfortable when you are forced to interrogate your own biases, unconscious or otherwise. But it’s imperative that we do it anyway. We benefit from the racism in our societal systems. We are the ones who need to fight that and demand change every day. It should never be on the oppressed to fight for the change that’s needed. So if you are devoted to being anti-racist and fighting against white supremacy, here are some places to start:

* **Educate yourself.** There are so many fantastic books and other resources out there. Don't turn to Black folks and ask them to teach you. Find the information yourself. It's out there! Scroll to the bottom to find lots of resources to start with.

* **Support the people on the ground, doing the work.** Money is always one of the best ways that you can show your support and uplift people and causes. If you can’t afford to donate money, consider offering your time or other resources, like using your car to transport items or people during the protests. In DC, on June 3rd, protestors are accepting supply donations at Red Bear Brewing. They need items like non-perishable, nut-free snacks, saline solution, heat-resistant gloves, athletic tape, reusable bags, and protective gas masks. If you can spear any of these items, drop them off outside of [Red Bear Brewing](https://www.redbear.beer/) in NE DC.

* **Elevate the voices of activists that have been doing this work.** There are already so many people out there who are fighting this fight every single day. Instead of clogging the airwaves with your own thoughts and questions, you should follow, support, and elevate the people who are already in it.

  * Some suggestions to start with:

    * [Rachel Cargle](https://maggiegermano.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7b0d49f10f1aef89a45167c3b&id=cbd7643342&e=ca1ae675af)

    * [Ericka Hines](https://maggiegermano.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7b0d49f10f1aef89a45167c3b&id=968ba4a369&e=ca1ae675af)

    * [Sonya Renee Taylor](https://maggiegermano.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7b0d49f10f1aef89a45167c3b&id=67973695a3&e=ca1ae675af)

* **Call your elected officials.** If you think your local government hasn't been doing enough to prevent and punish police brutality, let them know. Call your councilperson, your mayor, your county executive, your state legislator, your Congressperson. Let them know that you see what is happening and you are not okay with it. Let them know that the people in their community want things to change now.

* **Don’t default to calling the police on your neighbors of color.** As we’ve seen, time and again, the police aren’t always here to protect citizens of color. Remember that when you think about calling the police. Consider being an active bystander to interrupt tense situations, but do keep your own safety in mind. To learn more about being an active bystander, check out [Collective Action for Safe Spaces](https://maggiegermano.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7b0d49f10f1aef89a45167c3b&id=ab4209e774&e=ca1ae675af).

* **Get yourself on the front lines during protests.** Of course, we are still in the middle of a global pandemic, so if you are immunocompromised or you feel otherwise unsafe being in large groups of people right now, that’s okay. But if you feel comfortable joining in, go! Put yourself between black folks and the police. Show your black neighbors that you mean what you say when you say that black lives matter.

* **Spend your money at Black-owned companies.** Financial empowerment is huge when it comes to uplifting communities. That's why it's so important to invest in Black-owned businesses in your area. A great place to start is this [central database](https://maggiegermano.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7b0d49f10f1aef89a45167c3b&id=80fc29c701&e=ca1ae675af) for Black-owned businesses.

**PS:** I'm taking a break on the Money Circle podcast this week, because I want to specifically elevate the issues that affect the Black community in the United States. If you are or know of someone who would want to be interviewed about the issues listed below, send me a note at [boss@maggiegermano.com](mailto:boss@maggiegermano.com)!

* How white people and other non-Black people can be better allies to actually be anti-racist and fight against white supremacy and police violence

* Why Black wealth matters and how to even the financial playing field across race

* Why cash bail is racist and wrong and what should be instituted instead

* How allies can use their wallets to fight white supremacy and support their Black neighbors, friends, colleagues, family members, etc.

I'm always looking for more resources and ways to learn. If you have anything that has been important or helpful for you, please send it my way.
