You're not alone!

According to the IRS, early tax return volume was down by 33% compared to last year. There could be a few reasons for that, including the later deadline (April 18 vs. April 15). But I think there is often a lot more to it than just deadlines. We often avoid things because of emotional reasons. Personally, I put off doing my taxes for over a month longer than I usually do, because I knew I had to include my business expenses and earnings. I felt intimidated and was worried that I would do it wrong. So I put it off. Turns out, it took a little extra time, but I got through it, and got a pretty great refund check!

I put out the call to my Money Circle folks, and asked them why they've put off doing their taxes. The responses were pretty consistent, and not very surprising.

**"I knew I'd owe."**

A couple people responded saying that they knew they'd owe money on their taxes this year. They weren't necessarily putting off filing in order to *avoid* paying, but they wanted to be able to save up the money first.

**"I was waiting to receive all my documents."**

Although it's legally required for employers to mail out W-2s by January 31st, that doesn't always happen. Several people had been waiting for their W-2s to arrive, along with other financial paperwork, like 1099s from your bank or investment firms.

**"My taxes this year are complicated."**

Some people switched jobs, moved to a new state, made new investments, or spent money on business. It can be intimidating to try to figure out how to file your taxes when your financial situation has changed.

**"It's a lot of pressure."**

When something is required of you, and potentially high stakes, it can feel like a lot of pressure. This can create a mental block, which makes it the last thing you want to do at the end of the day.

**"I'm lazy."**

Some people just don't feel like filing their taxes yet! It's not like it's a fun activity. And I can fully understand that.

**"I feared making a mistake."**

Some respondents have been burned in the past. They made a mistake on their tax return, or missed an error, and then they had to pay for it (literally) later. Even though mistakes are totally human, they were afraid of feeling inadequate and having to deal with the aftermath.
