When I first started my business, I had no idea what I was doing. All I knew was that I wanted to help women get their money right. But there's so much more to a business than just the mission that you're hoping to fulfill. There's also the financial side of business. And I don't just mean bringing in money, I also mean systematizing and managing the money that is coming in and going out. This is imperative if you want to create and build a business that will last. But don't expect yourself to just know how to manage your business finances. You have to learn. Follow the steps below and you'll be in good shape.

## Open a Business Bank Account

Even if you're the only person working for your business, it's important to keep your business finances and personal finances separate.

One of the best decisions I ever made as a brand new business owner was to open up a business bank account. This made it so much easier to track my income and business expenses so that I was very clear on how much I would have to pay in taxes later.

Save yourself a lot of headaches and open up a separate account as soon as you start doing business. There are big banks that offer business banking, like Capital One (which also have savings and credit card options), but there are also startups that don’t have fees, like Azlo (just checking). Depending on what you need, you can choose what’s right for you.

## Track Your Income and Expenses

Especially when you’re new, you don’t need to hire a full-time accountant. There are so many accounting platforms out there these days that are reasonably priced and easy to use. Wave is free, while platforms like FreshBooks and Quicken Self-Employed have a small monthly fee.

Subscribing to one of these platforms will allow you to see your business income and expenses all in one place. You can even link it to your bank account and/or credit card so that it can update automatically, which will save you time and stress.

## Save for Taxes All Year

When you are self-employed, you don’t have a payroll department taking taxes out of your paycheck for you. This is a not-so-fun task that you have to do yourself.

My advice would be to automatically set 30% of your income aside as soon as you get it. Set up a savings account that you nickname “taxes” and don’t touch it for anything else.

You will also need to pay estimated quarterly taxes as a freelancer, so it’s important to have that money on hand.

If you know that you won’t remember to take this step, or if it’s just not something you want to handle yourself, there are companies out there that will do it for you. For example, you can set up an account with Painless 1099 and they will automatically set tax money aside whenever you get paid.

## Save for Emergencies

Emergency funds are not just for your personal life. Your business needs one too. This is especially true if you have overhead like payroll. You want to make sure you'll be able to pay your bills and your employees if you go through a slow month or lose a big client.

## Hire a Tax Accountant

As your tax situation gets more complicated, the time may come that you should hire a tax expert to file your taxes for you.

Yes, this costs money, but it might actually save you money in the long run. An expert knows exactly what you need to include when preparing your tax returns, and can get you as many write-offs as possible. Plus, you can write off the cost of filing your taxes, as it counts as a business expense!

My life changed a lot in 2018. I went full-time with my business, I owned a home, I got married, and I ran an Airbnb out of my basement. I didn’t feel confident that I would be able to prepare my taxes as well as an expert, so I hired one.

It’s an excellent investment in peace of mind.
