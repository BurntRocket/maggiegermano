Congratulations, you're married! And the wedding planning part of life is finally over! Plus, if you're lucky, you're walking away from your wedding with a nice chunk of change. But it's important to have a plan when you get a windfall like this. You don't want to find yourself a few months from now with no money left and nothing to show for it.

Of course, how you use the money depends on you and your partner's goals and responsibilities. But there are some basics that you should focus on when spending that money.

## Pay Off Debt

I know this doesn't sound fun. No one likes to pay off debt with gift money. But it's actually hugely important to pay off your debt if you can! If you have any credit card debt (or debt accrued during wedding planning), you should absolutely put your wedding money towards it. This will help you and your new spouse start your marriage on more solid financial footing.
