It's been less than a month since I got married! In fact, we just got back from our honeymoon this past Friday. It's been a whirlwind and I have a lot to say about the whole process. Before I got engaged, I heard a lot of positive stories about wedding planning. I now believe that everyone was lying. For me, wedding planning was awful. And I've now heard that from a bunch of my friends too! It's expensive, it's stressful, it's overwhelming, and it's all over after one day. Throw in the fact that I'm a control freak and there's a lot of uncontrollable pieces in wedding planning, and you have a nightmare! But planning and having a wedding doesn't have to be awful, so I want you to learn from my mistakes. 

## Only Looking at One Venue

This is definitely the biggest mistake we made, in terms of cost. I fell in love with our venue over a year before we even got engaged. We visited the space to do a wine tasting on a day off, and I immediately knew I wanted to get married there. I even told Dan, "I know we haven't talked about marriage yet, but if you proposed to me right now, I'd say yes." So, once we did a tour of the space when we knew we'd be getting engaged, we decided to have our wedding there.

Maybe we would have decided to get married there even after looking at other venues! It is a beautiful space that had a lot of what we were looking for. But at least with other estimates and options, we would know if we'd had more affordable venues to choose from. I would have also gotten a more realistic idea of what venues charge and what they provide. I could have compared the opportunities and limitations of each and made an informed decision. But we didn't do that, so every time we were frustrated with our venue, we wondered if we'd make a stupid mistake.

I highly recommend looking at multiple venues, even if you think you've found "the one".

## Not Always Listening to My Gut

We spent more than double what I wanted to spend on our wedding. Yes, I had unrealistic (and nonexistent) expectations of how much weddings cost. Yes, I got a little carried away with things being beautiful. But I'm still a little regretful (and slightly ashamed) of how much we ended up spending on the wedding. Luckily, we aren't going into debt for it, but on principle, I wish we'd spent less.

Anyway, what does my gut have to do with this? 

## Inviting People I Didn't Want to Invite

The guest list and RSVP process was a lot more stressful than I expected. There are a lot of politics and emotions involved that I didn't anticipate. Inviting people out of obligation made it so that I wasn't able to invite certain people I would have preferred to invite. It also brought up a lot of negative emotion and stress when RSVPs were due. Ultimately, a lot of those obligatory invitees declined the invite, which makes it even clearer that it wasn't necessary to extend the invite in the first place. (Plus, many of them didn't RSVP at all, and I had to reach out to them.)

It can be tough to navigate family politics in this area, but it's important to feel good about who will be at your wedding. I feel even more strongly about this if you and your partner are paying for your wedding yourselves.

## Not Asserting Myself with Our Vendors

One of our vendors provided a day-of coordinator for our wedding. We didn't want to hire this vendor at all, because they were pushy and wanted to overcharge us for everything, but we were required to use them for a few things by our venue. We considered using them for the bare minimum, but when we found out they provide a coordinator if you do a slightly larger package, we decided to go for it. We figured that would be a whole lot easier than setting up the wedding ourselves, or delegating friends and family to be in charge of everything.

It turns out, we were wrong. The day-of coordinator was pretty unreliable throughout the entire planning process. So much so that I didn't trust that the day would go smoothly at all. She would take up to two weeks to respond to us, she always seemed like she had no idea what our wedding details were, and she just seemed to do the bare minimum in her communciations with us.
