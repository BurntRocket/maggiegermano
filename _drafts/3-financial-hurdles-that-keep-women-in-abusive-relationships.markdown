October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. This is the time, every year, when advocates raise the issue of domestic violence so that more people will be aware of and informed about domestic violence and how it affects countless victims. As a woman, a feminist, a financial coach, and an advocate, this issue is incredibly important to me. 

According to the [National Coalition Against Domestic Violence](https://ncadv.org/statistics), 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experience severe intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner contact sexual violence, and/or intimate partner stalking. That means that a quarter of all women will at some point experience abuse from their intimate partner. That is a huge number.
