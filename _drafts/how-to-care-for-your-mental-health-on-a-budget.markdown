September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. This issue is still shrouded in stigma, which only makes people feel more alone. Itâ€™s a vicious cycle. Mental health is a hard thing to prioritize in general, but it gets even harder if you're tight on money. Plus, financial problems can cause even more mental health issues. So here are some budget-friendly options if you're feeling hopeless.

## Ask for help

First of all, it's important to know that **you are not alone**. Major depression is one of the most common mental illnesses, affecting 6.7% (or more than 16 million) of American adults each year. We tend to keep quiet about these issues, but I guarantee there are other people in your life who have been through the same thing as you have. Who in your life can you trust? Who do you feel comfortable confiding in? 

If you don't feel comfortable confiding in someone you know about your depression or suicidal thoughts, you can reach out to someone else. Call the [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) at 1-800-273-8255. 

## Join a support group

There are so many support groups out there. There is one for every issue you can imagine. There are [in-person](https://adaa.org/supportgroups) options, but there are [online](https://www.inspire.com/groups/mental-health-america/) opportunities, if that is preferable to you. 

## Use a therapy/support app

Technology can truly be a wonderful thing. There are many apps out there that make it easier for us to access mental health professionals. Since it can be so hard to find a good therapist, this is a great alternative. 

* [Code Blue](http://codeblue.io/) is an app that will alert your support network when you're in need. Specifically designed for teens, this app lets your family or friends know in real time when you're being bullied or feeling depressed or suicidal.


* [PTSD Coach](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/materials/apps/ptsdcoach.asp) is an app that was developed by Veterans Affairs to help veterans deal with PTSD symptoms. The app is also available to civilians, and it connects you to resources and support in your area.


* [Talkspace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talkspace-therapy/id661829386?mt=8) is probably the most well-known therapy app. It connects you with a licensed therapist via chat. You do have to pay $30 a week for this therapist, but it could be a great option if you don't have health insurance that covers therapy.

## Find out what your insurance covers

Mental health coverage in the U.S. is woefully inadequate. Many of us are not receiving the help and treatment that we need and deserve.
