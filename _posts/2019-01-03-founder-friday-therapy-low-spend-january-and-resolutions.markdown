Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We had two Airbnb guests stay with us this week.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I went a bit over budget last month, and I'm not feeling great about it. We also have a few potentially expensive projects coming up, so we need to be careful with our spending this month. Accordingly, we didn't spend too much this week. 

* We spent a hefty sum on groceries this week. Not only were we hosting a New Years Day brunch, but we stocked up on some healthy essentials to keep us on track this month.

* Today, I had lunch at DC Noodles with a friend and fellow coach, [Heather D. Horton](https://www.heatherdhorton.com/). If you're looking for a grief coach, you should contact her!

* I finally found a new therapist who takes my insurance, and I had my initial intake session with her. Now that I'm on Dan's health insurance, I can choose an in-network therapist who is convenient to me and pay the 20% co-pay.

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about which [steps you can take](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-get-your-financial-life-in-order-in-2019/) in 2019 to get your money life together. If you don't know where to start, this article is a good place to turn.

## What I’m Up To

* The [January Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-financial-resolutions-that-last-tickets-54309667678) is scheduled and ready for you!
