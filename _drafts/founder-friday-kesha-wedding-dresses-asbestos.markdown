## How I Earned Money This Week

## How I Spent Money This Week

* I went out to lunch with two friends on Monday. I spent $9 on tacos at District Taco. Yum.

* Homeownership is something. Somedays it feels like an actual money pit. I love our house but... it's expensive. This week, I spent $500 to get the vermiculite insulation in our attic tested for asbestos. Hurray! Luckily, I still had money set aside for this type of expense, so I didn't have to take a hit financially. 

## What I'm Writing

This week, I wrote about why I decided to quit my very stable day job and become a full-time entrepreneur. [Read it here](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/why-i-quit-my-day-job/)!

## What I'm Excited About

## What I'm Fan-Girling Over

* Kesha's performance of "Praying" at the Grammy's. I'm less keen on [Sony's tweet](https://www.spin.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-kesha-dr-luke-sony-music-tweet/) about the performance, considering they counter-sued her to keep her tethered to her abuser, Dr. Luke.
