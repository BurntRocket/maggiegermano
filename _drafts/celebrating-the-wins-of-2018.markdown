* **I Took My Business Full-Time**

* **I Got ICF Certified**

Last year, I received my first coaching certification through [CoachDiversity Institute](https://coachdiversity.com/). This year, I took the next step of getting certified by the [International Coach Federation](https://coachfederation.org/), as they are viewed as the authority on coaching certification. I am now both a Certified Professional Diversity Coach and an Associate Certified Coach. 

* **I Ran an Airbnb Rental**

When Dan and I were looking to buy a house last year, one of my big priorities was to find a house with a basement that we could rent out. I knew we could afford our mortgage ourselves, but I also wanted to have a potential extra income source. We got lucky and found a house with a finished basement and its own entrance. Since we finished fixing it up in February, we've been running it as an Airbnb rental. It's actually been really successful! We get guests from all over the world, either to visit the University of Maryland or DC. Next year, our county will be implementing some limitations to how often we can rent out the space during the year, but I'm still optimistic about the extra income it will bring. 

* **My Business Won An Award**

I won the Women Empowerment Entrepreneur of the Year Award from the DC Women's Business Center this year! 

* **I Hired a Financial Planner**

I may be a financial coach, but I'm not a certified financial planner, so I wanted to get a little extra help managing my money. Especially after this year, when I took a pay cut by quitting my job, I wanted to make sure Dan and I were staying on the right track financially. We hired my friend, Jessie Hill, to advise us on our retirement savings, and also to buy life insurance. You're better off locking in life insurance when you're young and healthy, so we wanted to get on top of that now. 

* **I Got Married**

You may have noticed, based on my wedding-heavy content, that I got married this year! As you also may have noticed, I didn't love the planning process, so I'm glad to finally be married.
