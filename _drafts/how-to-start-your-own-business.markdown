October is National Women's Small Business Month! [As of 2015](https://www.nawbo.org/resources/women-business-owner-statistics), 9.1 million business in the United States were owned by women, 2.9 million of which are owned by women of color. These businesses generate $1.4 trillion dollars in sales. This has been a huge increase from years past. So basically, women are kicking ass in business! More women than ever are striking out on their own.

Are you one of them? Obviously, you're not alone, so I want to help you get started.

## Narrow in on your idea

Get clear on your vision. What do you want to bring to the world with your business? The more specific you can get, the better. You don't necessarily have to write a business plan at this point, but you should know exactly what you want to do with your business. 

## Come up with a name

You need an official business name in order to legally start a business. This name will be on your legal paperwork, on any business bank accounts or credit cards you open, and on your tax forms. You'll probably also use it on your website and other public platforms. So make sure you like it! I personally could not come up with a name that I trusted I'd like long-term. I didn't want to end up changing the name later on and possibly losing some of my audience. That's why I ended up just using my own name. I know my name won't change (even after I get married), so I trust that there won't be a reason to change it.

Make sure the name you choose reflects what your business is meant to do. And make sure you'll feel proud and excited to introduce your business to strangers.

*Do you have a business? What was your name-choosing process? Share in the comments!*

## Decide what kind of business you want to be

There are a couple options to choose from: limited liability company (LLC) or a corporation (you can choose from an S corp or a C corp). Do your research and see which would work best for you. I'm personally registered as an LLC, because I'm the only person working for me so far. However, being an LLC protects my personal assets if anyone takes legal action against me as a business owner. 

## Register your business

I found this part to be really easy in the District of Columbia. You go [online](https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/page/new-business-registration) and register your business and pay about $200. That initial fee is then owed again every two years (at least in DC). These rules and fees can vary by state, so do your research. You also probably have to hire a Registered Agent, who will serve as the recipient of any legal documents for your business. The one I chose only costs $49 a year, and I haven't had to

## Open a business bank account

It's very important to separate your business finances from your personal finances. This helps with planning, taxes, and tracking expenses. I would also recommend that you open at least one savings account for your business as well. I have one for taxes and one for expenses. It's important to have backup money for your business, just like you would for your personal expenses.

When you choose a bank, bring your licensing documents with you. You'll need them to open the account. You'll also need an employer identification number, which you can get really easily [here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online).

## Sign up for free business counseling

The Washington, DC [Women's Business Center](http://www.ncrc.org/dcwbc/how-to-register-for-free-counseling.html) offers free one-on-one business counseling. They can help you come up with a business plan, and give advice on ... I went to a few sessions when I first started my business, and it was very helpful.

## Register as a woman-owned business

As of now, the federal government is required to contract with a certain percentage of woman-owned businesses. You can even apply for specific grants or contracts *because* you're a woman who owns a business.
