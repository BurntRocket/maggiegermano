Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

**How I Earned Money This Week**

* Dan’s bi-weekly paycheck came through.

* One of my new clients paid her monthly fee.

* I led a budgeting workshop at **[Mindspace](https://www.mindspace.me/)** this week. The payment should be coming through from Eventbrite soon.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I republished my [ForbesWomen](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/despite-their-priorities-nearly-half-of-americans-over-55-still-dont-have-a-will/) piece about why it's so important to get your estate planning documents in order.

## **What I’m Up To**

* On Wednesday, March 27th, I’ll be hosting Money Circle. We’ll be joined by personal style coach, [Allison Hamilton-Rohe](https://dailyoutfit.com/), since our topic is: [How To Create a Powerful Personal Style On A Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-create-a-powerful-personal-style-on-a-budget-tickets-54939672038).

* April  Money Circle

* I want to hear from you! As I am continuing to create blog content and expanding my work into online courses, a podcast, and more workshops, I want to make sure I’m creating things that are useful to YOU. I’ve made a survey for my clients and readers to hear about what you most want to learn about.
