TGIF! 

## How I Earned Money This Week

* Two of my clients' monthly payments went through this week.

* We had so many Airbnb guests this week! Now that we're fairly established as hosts, the payments go through on the day that the guests check in.

* I finally filed my taxes! This year was tough, because so much has changed. I bought a house, changed states, and increased my self-employment revenue. Luckily, I'm getting a hefty tax refund, and the majority of it will go towards our wedding savings.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I celebrated our 4th anniversary this Wednesday (Pi Day ftw)! We had dinner at the wonderful [Toki Underground](https://www.tokiunderground.com/).

## What I’m Excited About

* Tickets for Collective Action for Safe Spaces' [Safe Space Jam](https://collectiveactiondc.givezooks.com/events/safe-space-jam-2018) are officially on sale! Early bird tickets are available until March 24th. CASS works everyday to make DC a safer place for everyone, and this annual event is a great way to support their work, meet the community, and bid on some great silent auction items. I hope to see you there! PS: if you're not in the DC area, you can still support CASS by [donating](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/collectiveactiondc).
