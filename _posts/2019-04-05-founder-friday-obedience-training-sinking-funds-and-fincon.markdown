Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We've had Airbnb guests non-stop this week.

* One new client paid for her first monthly fee.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Continuing the trend of spending too much money on our puppy, we made another Chewy order this week. We bought Bruno a rain coat, a new food bowl, chew sticks, and a few other things.

* I ran out of my favorite tea and protein powder last week, so I added them to my subscribe and save option on Amazon this week.

* We did our usual grocery run to Safeway on Monday. 

* I had a photoshoot for an upcoming event and then attended a [Freelancer's Union](https://www.freelancersunion.org/) event nearby on Wednesday. I took a Lyft to and from Eastern Market for these.

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about how to use ["sinking funds"](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-use-sinking-funds-to-save-for-goals-all-year/) to save for bigger goals all year round. 

## What I’m Up To

* My panel has been chosen for this year's [FinCon](https://finconexpo.com/) in Washington, DC! I'm excited to join [Cait Howerton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caithowertonmba/), [Kelsa Dickey](https://fiscalfitnessphx.com/), [Ericka Young](https://www.tailormadebudgets.com/), and [Holly Morphew](https://www.financialimpact.com/) on the stage.

* The [April Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-honoring-self-care-keeping-your-pockets-full-tickets-59004572264) meet up is ready for registration! We’ll be joined by Megan Sanchez of Upswing Health Coaching to talk about prioritizing self-care while on a budget.

* My friend and real estate agent, [Liz Ho](https://www.rlahre.com/agent/liz-ho/), and I are hosting a buyer’s salon in DC on Wednesday, April 24th. [Join us for this free event!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/what-does-it-financially-take-to-buy-a-home-a-buyers-salon-tickets-59796021510)

* I want to hear from you! As I am continuing to create blog content and expanding my work into online courses, a podcast, and more workshops, I want to make sure I’m creating things that are useful to YOU. I’ve made a survey for my clients and readers to hear about what you most want to learn about.

## What I’m Excited About

* It's finally spring in DC! I plan to spend as much time outside as possible this weekend. I'll also take advantage of the weather to do some outdoor home maintenance, like painting my front porch floor and putting new mulch in the front garden. 

* Dan and I are going to test drive some cars at a Mazda dealership tomorrow morning. I've never bought a car before, but it's time to have a car that I can actually drive (Dan's car is a stick shift). I haven't driven in a while, so I'm a little nervous, but I'm also excited to test drive some cars so that we can narrow down our search. 

## What I'm Reading

I'm trying out a new section of this blog post! It's not money-related (usually) but it might be fun. I will be sharing what book(s) I'm reading at that moment and what I think of them. I know I like to hear what other people enjoy reading, so I thought you might enjoy the same from me.

This week, I am finishing up *[The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls](https://www.amazon.com/Care-Feeding-Ravenously-Hungry-Girls/dp/1984802437)* by Anissa Gray. It is also my book club's book of the month. I've sped through the book and I'm enjoying it, although it's incredibly sad.
