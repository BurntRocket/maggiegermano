Full disclosure: I had never heard of a personal loan until I started coaching women around money. I knew what student loans, parent loans, car loans, and home loans were. But I didn't know what a personal loan was and why you would need one. Ever since I became a financial coach, the topic of personal loans has come up a lot. That's because many of the women who come to be are struggling with credit card debt and don't always see a way out of it. A personal loan can be a lifesaver for some people, but it's not always the solution. And it's definitely not a miracle cure for overspending and debt.
