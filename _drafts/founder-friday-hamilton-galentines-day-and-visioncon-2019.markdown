Happy Friday! I hope you're staying dry and warm out there. Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* Three of my clients' monthly payments went through this week.

* Dan's bi-weekly paycheck came in today.

* We had a slowdown with our Airbnb over the past month, but we luckily had guests during the week and more guests this weekend! We're hoping that's a sign that travel to the area will pick up again.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Groceries

* Valentine's Day gifts

* Money Circle snacks

## **What I’m Writing**

* An important topic to me is learning how to show your love without blowing your budget. This week, I wrote about [how to celebrate](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-celebrate-valentines-day-without-buying-gifts/) occasions like Valentine's Day without necessarily buying a gift. 

* I also published a new ForbesWomen piece about the disconnect between those who believe they should have their end-of-life affairs in order and those who actually follow through with it. 

## **What I’m Up To**

* opp loans

* vision con

* lemon collective

* mindspace

* money circle

* medium

## **What I’m Excited About**

* Hamilton

* 

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

That’s all from me today! Have a fantastic weekend!
