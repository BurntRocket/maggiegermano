I'm sure you can picture it: you get your mail just like any other day. You open a plain, white envelope.

## Confirm the Debt is Actually Yours

There are a lot of scammers out there, especially those trying to scare you into giving them money. (Have you ever gotten one of those phone calls saying you owe money to the IRS? Pro tip: those calls are NEVER real. The IRS only communicates via snail mail, on official letterhead.) It's no different when it comes to someone telling them you're being sued for your debt.

## Ask for Proof

If you don't recognize the debt or the name of the creditor, respond to the letter immediately. There should be the name and contact information of the lawyer representing the plaintiff.

If you don't show up, the judge will almost certainly rule in favor of the creditor and you will owe the full amount. If you do show up, you at least have the opportunity to make your own case and show any proof you have if the debt isn't yours.
