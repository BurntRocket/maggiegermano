I'm not an expert on financial regulation, by any means. But I do know that after living through (and graduating during) the Great Recession, I am very supportive of financial regulation. 

Before I go into detail on the Fiduciary Rule, let's take a walk down memory lane. 

In a financial context, a fiduciary is required to act in the best interest of the person or party whose assets they're managing. If your investment advisor is a registered investment advisor, they have a fiduciary responsibility and are required to act in your best interest. However, many brokers, insurance professionals, and others in the financial industry do not.

The fiduciary rule was formally proposed by the Department of Labor in April 2016 and was passed shortly thereafter. The rule is currently scheduled to be phased in from April 10, 2017 through January 1, 2018. The fiduciary rule is designed to make all financial professionals who provide retirement planning advice or work with retirement plans accountable to the fiduciary standard.

Who can you trust with your money?

1\. Look for companies that have your best interest in mind
