Happy Friday, y'all! For some reason, I was really lethargic and emotional this week. It felt like I was struggling to get anything done. I made it through, and I accomplished almost all of my tasks, but I'm sure happy it's almost the weekend. This weekend, I'm going to celebrate a lovely friend's birthday and spend some quality time with my dude. What are you up to this weekend?

## How I Earned Money This Week

* One of my client's monthly payments went through.

* We have two different sets of Airbnb guests this week.

* Technically this isn't making money, because we're just getting a rebate for money we already spent. BUT the Pepco rebate for the insulation work we had done was approved and we should be getting that soon! We also submitted a rebate request to Pepco for an Energy Star Certified [dehumidifier](https://homeenergysavings.pepco.com/appliance-rebate-program) we bought for the basement.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* On Sunday, we went to our wedding venue to meet with the day-of coordinator and do a tasting with our caterer. The pizza tasting itself was free but we did buy a few glasses of wine to go with it.

* Mother's Day is coming up, so I bought my mom a card from one of [my favorite Etsy shops](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheAnastasiaCo?ref=pr_faveshops), and my sisters and I are going in on a couple gifts together.

* I decided to try [Care/Of](https://takecareof.com/), finally. I like that you answer a quiz to determine what types of vitamins you might need, and then they send them in daily packets with your name on it. I had a 50% off coupon as a new customer, so it is worth trying! If you [use my link](https://takecareof.com/invites/mgwpaq), you'll get $40 off your first month! That would most likely cover the full cost, so check it out!

## What I’m Writing

This week (and this month, really) is all about weddings! I wrote about [how to create a wedding budget](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-create-a-wedding-budget/) once you get engaged. Stay tuned all month for wedding-themed posts!

## What I’m Excited About

* I did my first webinar this week! I teamed up with life and career coach Noelle Janka to talk about how you can take control of your money right now. It was a blast! Would you want to see me do more webinars? What topics would you want me to cover? Comment below or send me an email at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com)!

* Dan and I are going to Frederick, Maryland for Memorial Day weekend! We waited too long to make a decision, so there are no Airbnbs available downtown that entire weekend. So we decided to splurge on one night at an actual, real-life bed and breakfast. We'll be staying in the "Poet's Loft", which sounds very quaint. It'll be nice to get out of town, even just for one night. We plan to drink lots of craft beer and visit many antique shops. What's your favorite thing to do in Frederick? Share in the comments!

## What I’m Up To

* I was quoted in the new website [I Am & Co](https://iamandco.com/blog/borrowing-money) this week, talking about whether or not you should borrow money from loved ones. What do you think? Have you done that before? What was your experience?

* I was interviewed for the [HerStory](http://herstryblg.com/our-interviews/2018/5/9/interview-maggie-germano) blog! I talk about how I became an entrepreneur and why it's important that women share their stories. Check it out and let me know what you think.

* I’m starting a financial advice column! I don’t know when I’ll have it up and running yet, but I’ve already answered a few questions that will be published when it’s ready. I need to pick the name and have Dan make some new branding for the column, and then I’ll be ready to go! The premise of the column will be similar to my coaching style and other writing. Helpful advice without judgment. Got questions? Email me at **[hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com)**!

## Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend

I loved this tip from [The Financial Diet](http://thefinancialdiet.com/), and couldn't put it any better:

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
