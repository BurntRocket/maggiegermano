I am not one of those financial bloggers who tells you that you have to give up every single thing you love in order to get your money right. I don't think it's sustainable to deprive yourself of anything that brings you joy just because it costs money. Yes, you probably have to make some sacrifices, but you don't have to give up everything. There are ways to cut spending, pay down debt, build up savings, AND still have fun. So let's do it!

## First, remind yourself of what you value most

## Second, review your recent expenses

## Next, prioritize your spending

## Then, automate!

I've said this before, and I will say it for the rest of my life: you have to automate to reach your money goals! Whether it's paying down debt or building up savings, automation takes the thought and human error out of the equation. So if you want to make sure you have enough money to buy gifts during the holidays, to go on vacation once a year, to get a massage every month... whatever it is! Make sure you're setting that money aside without even thinking about it. I think the best move is to open up a savings account for that specific thing, and have money deposited into it directly from your paycheck. For example, I always want to have enough money on hand to go get a massage or buy a new outfit. To make that possible without busting my budget, I automate $100 a month into a special "fun" savings account. I only touch that money for things that are what I would consider a "splurge".
