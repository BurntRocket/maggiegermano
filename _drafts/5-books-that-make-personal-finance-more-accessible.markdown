Did you know that I wasn't born with all of the financial literacy that I have now? Shocking, I know. No, really, I actually had to learn the things that I know. Financial literacy is not something that is innate. Yes, my personality means that I tend to be more organized with my money and more focused on my financial goals. But I still had to find resources that were interesting to me and easy to understand. That's the important part - you have to find the personal finance advice that speaks to you and makes you feel like you can achieve your goals. For example, if you're underpaid and living paycheck to paycheck, Suze Orman may not be the one to read. But you're in luck! Below are five books that I think make personal finance more accessible and interesting to everyone.

## [Smart Women Finish Rich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25645.Smart_Women_Finish_Rich) by David Bach

If you know me or if you've been following my blog for a while, you're probably very surprised to see that my first book recommendation was written by a middle-aged white man. However, this book was the very first personal finance book I ever read! It was gifted to me when I completed my internship at the National Wildlife Federation. I was only 22 years old and the information in this book woke up my passion for learning about money. I'd always been fairly careful with my money, but this book showed me how important it really is to be smart with my money and also gave me the tools to do so. I haven't re-read it since then, so I'm not sure how well it's aged, but I do recommend it as a good place to start.

David Bach has written many other books in addition to this one. Another good one to read is *[Smart Couples Finish Rich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6301.Smart_Couples_Finish_Rich)*.

## [Financially Fearless](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17737028-financially-fearless?ac=1&from_search=true) by Alexa Von Tobel

This is the second personal finance book that I remember being really affected by. I even attended a book tour event for it in DC! Alexa Von Tobel founded Learnvest, which used to be my favorite budgeting platform and personal finance blog (it now seems to be defunct after Northwest Mutual bought it). This book is easy to read, straight forward, and digestible. It gives you all the financial information that you need to get your money right, plus it gives clear action steps that you can take to move forward. 

I haven't read it yet, but Alexa also just released a new book called *[Financially Forward](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42601024-financially-forward)*.

## [Broke Millennial](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32335700-broke-millennial?ac=1&from_search=true) by Erin Lowry

If you love this book and want to expand your financial knowledge to investing, check out Erin's newest book *[Broke Millennial Takes On Investing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41108699-broke-millennial-takes-on-investing)*.

## [The Financial Feminist Handbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41073145-the-feminist-financial-handbook?ac=1&from_search=true) by Brynne Conroy

Any book with the words "financial feminist" in the title is going to catch my eye. Add someone as great as Brynne Conroy and you have a winner. I met Brynne at FinCon a few years ago and we bonded over our shared passion for women's empowerment and financial literacy. I was so excited to find out earlier this year that she was publishing her first book. 

## [Clever Girl Finance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43119516-clever-girl-finance) by Bola Sokunbi

I've been following Bola and Clever Girl Finance since I got into the money game nearly four years ago. 

There is so much personal finance goodness out there, so if you can't get enough after reading these five books, here are a few more to check out:
