Happy Friday! 

## How I Earned Money This Week

* I got two new ongoing clients this week!

* We had two different sets of Airbnb guests throughout this week. I really like that the payments go through the day that the guests check in, so we don't have to wait for it.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* We sent the final payment for our wedding venue this week. It's nice to slowly cross things off the list so we don't have to worry about them anymore. This weekend, we're meeting with two different vendors to go over their responsibilities and ask questions.

* On Wednesday evening, Dan and I met up with a group of friends to have drinks and catch up. We spent more than I had hoped on beer, but luckily had a free [&pizza](https://andpizza.com/) coupon for afterwards. 

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about [investing in yourself](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/when-why-and-how-to-invest-in-yourself/). Yes, it's important to invest in your retirement, but you should also make investments in your well-being and happiness. That might look like going back to school or [hiring a financial coach](https://www.maggiegermano.com/coaching/)!

## What I’m Excited About

* The save the dates for my wedding went out last week! It's real now. This weekend, we're doing a tasting with our caterer. It's still six months away, but it's starting to feel like we're making real progress.

* I am officially a certified coach through the [International Coaching Federation](https://coachfederation.org/) (ICF)! I was already certified through [CoachDiversity Institute](http://coachdiversity.com/), but ICF is the international standard for certification. If the coaching industry ever becomes regulated, I'll be in a good position.

## What I’m Up To

* **I'm starting a financial advice column!** I don't know when I'll have it up and running yet, but I've already answered a few questions that will be published when it's ready. I need to pick the name and have Dan make some new branding for the column, and then I'll be ready to go! The premise of the column will be similar to my coaching style and other writing. Helpful advice without judgment. Got questions? Email me at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com)!

* The **[May Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-survive-wedding-season-on-a-budget/)** event is up! Next month, we’ll be talking about how to survive wedding season on a budget. We’ll be in Eastern Market for the evening. See you there?

* I’m teaming up with life and career coach **[Noelle Janka](http://www.noellejanka.com/)** for a **[webinar on May 10th](https://www.maggiegermano.com/other-events/webinar-how-to-take-control-of-your-money/)**! I’ll be talking to attendees about how they can take control of their money and set financial goals that align with their values.
