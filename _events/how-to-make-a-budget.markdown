Having a working budget is key to being financially stable. You have to know what is going in and out each month. But creating a budget and sticking to it is not exactly straightforward or easy. Many people simply don't know where to start, and need a little bit of guidance. I want to help you figure out how to make a budget that works for you! So come to Money Circle and together we'll map out budgets that we'll actually stick to.

Bring a list of your expenses and income. It will also be helpful if you have an average of how much you typically spend outside of bills each month. **Bonus points:** look up the dates that most of your bills are due.

*This event will take place near 11th and Otis Street NW in Columbia Heights. The exact location will be provided upon registration.*

We live in a society where money is an unspoken taboo. We aren’t supposed to ask people how much money they earn, and women especially have a hard time knowing and asking for what they are worth. It’s more important than ever to band together and put it all on the table.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.

**Refunds:** Money Circle is a limited seating event. If you have to cancel for any reason within 24 hours, your ticket is non-refundable. However, feel free to gift it or sell it to a friend! Just be sure to let me know of the exchange at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com).
