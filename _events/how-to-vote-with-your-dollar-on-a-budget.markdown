I talk a lot about voting with your dollar and only spending money on companies that share your values. It's a very powerful action. But how realistic is it when you're on a budget? This month, we'll gather to talk about HOW we can vote with our dollar when we don't have a lot of dollars to throw around. 

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.
