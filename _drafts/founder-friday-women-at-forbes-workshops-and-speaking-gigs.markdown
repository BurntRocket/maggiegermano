* The **[August Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/)** is planned and available for registration! We’ll be focusing on homebuying for first-timers, and we’ll be joined by the wonderful real estate agent (and dear friend) Liz Delgado-Steo. Liz is great at breaking down the homebuying process into language you can understand, so this is a meetup you can’t miss! **[Register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-homebuying-for-newbies-tickets-48132651055)**!

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

![It feels really natural to want to avoid your money problems. But that doesn't make them go away. In fact, it makes them even worse. So open up that bill that's been sitting on your counter. Call the creditor back.
