As a financial blogger, a lot of my writing and advice is fairly general. It's hard to give advice that can apply to individuals because there's no one-size-fits-all solution to personal finance. When I'm working with my clients one-on-one, I can give more specific advice, because I know them and I know their situation. However, I know that not everyone can afford (or wants to) work with me one-on-one, but I would still like to help people who have questions or conundrums. I get a lot of questions from family, friends, and clients that I think other people are probably wondering about as well. So I decided to start an advice column where I can answer individualized questions that others may have.
