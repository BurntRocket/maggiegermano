Happy Women's History Month! This month, my blog will focus on issues that specifically affect women and their financial futures. This particular week, I'm talking about periods. If any guys are reading, I'm not sorry! Menstruation is a normal (and essential) process that affects most people with uteruses at some point in their lives, oftentimes for up to 40 years! But just because menstruation is a naturally occurring process doesn't mean that it doesn't still result in financial trouble for women and girls. This piece will review those issues and then lay out some potential solutions.

## Menstruation Products Cost Money

the average woman spends about $120 per year on pads and tampons and an additional $20 each year on over-the-counter medication to combat cramps and other period-related side effects. Women on average menstruate for 40 years (taking into account that some women have children), so each woman spends approximately $5,600 on her period over her lifetime.

## Access Is Not Always a Given

Around the world, only 12 percent of young people with periods have access to the products they need.

Across the world, an estimated 100 million young people lack access to adequate menstrual products

Those are the reasons that menstruation impacts women's financial well-being. However, it is also a basic human right to have access to the things that your body needs. And obviously, feminine hygiene products are something menstruating people need once a month for more than half their lives.
