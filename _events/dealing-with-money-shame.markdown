Has anyone ever made you feel ashamed about money? Perhaps you find that you've been shaming yourself.

One of the biggest focuses of my business is money shame. It's one of those things that is so widespread that it continues to make money a taboo topic that no one wants to talk about. But shame also paralyzes us and makes it feel impossible to move forward and change our financial situation.

The truth is, though, many of us feel crappy about money in one way or another. The more we are honest about that, the less painful it will feel. That's why it's so important focus on how you can make changes to move forward, rather than punishing yourself for the past.

This month at Money Circle, we will get vulnerable and share our money shame with each other. We'll see that we aren't alone. And then we'll learn how to improve our relationship with money and let go of that shame.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks will be provided.
