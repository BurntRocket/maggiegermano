A few weeks ago, I was interviewed by a *Washington Post *reporter about wedding loans. My feedback wasn't included in the final piece, but the topic and the piece got me thinking. If you've been following my blog for a while, you know that I go married last year. I spent over a year planning my wedding and thinking and writing a whole lot about weddings. I am aware of how expensive weddings can be and how stressful that is. But I also feel very strongly that going into debt for your wedding is not a good idea.

Starting your married life with debt can prevent you from reaching other goals, like:

## Going on a Honeymoon

## Buying a Home

## Paying Off Other Debt

So what can you do instead?

## Delay Your Wedding

## Save The Cash

## Change Your Plans
