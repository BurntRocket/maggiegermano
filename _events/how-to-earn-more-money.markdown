Sometimes, budgeting and cutting spending isn't enough. Sometimes, you've done everything you can to live bare bones, but you still can't reach your goals. There are no more lattes to not buy. At that point, the only solution is to increase your income. This month, we'll gather to brainstorm ways to bring in more money, whether that be asking for a raise, or getting a second job.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.

**Payment:** You will be redirected Paypal to process your payment. Once completed, you will receive an email with details for the evening.

**Refunds:** Money Circle is a limited seating event. I also purchase wine and snacks based on the number of women joining us. Because of this, if you have to cancel for any reason within 24 hours, your ticket is non-refundable. However, feel free to gift it or sell it to a friend!
