## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* We haven't spent this money yet but we're a little anxious that it's going to happen. Over the past two years, I've written a lot about spending lots of money on home improvement. On Tuesday, a crack in a basement wall sprung a leak and was literally pouring water into the laundry room. We had a foundation expert come by yesterday to do a full inspection and it looks like we might need some major foundation work done. I'm trying not to freak out about it yet, since he had to write up a full report for us, and we're going to get a second opinion, but I'm so not thrilled. However, I do think it's important to protect the structural integrity of the house, so we'll do what we have to do.
