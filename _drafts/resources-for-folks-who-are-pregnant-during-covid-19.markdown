*Want to learn more about what you should know if you're pregnant during COVID-19? Listen to this week's [Money Circle episode](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/pregnancy-and-birth-during-the-covid-19-crisis/)!*

I'm in my 30s now, so the number of people I know who have kids or who are pregnant (or trying to get pregnant) is steadily increasing. That's a strange and exciting thing on its own, but COVID-19 is turning it into something completely different. I'm watching my friends struggle with the new reality of self-isolation and ongoing quarantine. I see them wonder what is safe and what isn't. Plus, there's so much unknown when it comes to the actual delivery process and who they can have with them or not. The global pandemic is scary for everyone, but it can feel even scarier for someone who is bringing new life into the world. That's why I am gathering these helpful resources to get you the information and support that you need if you're pregnant right now.

## CDC Guidelines

It can be difficult to know where to turn for up-to-date, accurate, information during times of crisis. It's even worse because there's a lot of misinformation out there right now. However, the folks at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have dedicated their lives to the study and control of disease, so they are a great place to start. It's still somewhat unsure how COVID-19 affects pregnant people and their fetuses, but there is new information being released everyday. [Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html) at their resource about pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## WHO Guidelines

Just like the CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO) is a trustworthy resource for COVID-19 information and updates. It might even be more trustworthy right now, since it is not an American federal agency [Learn more](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/emergencies/COVID-19-pregnancy-ipc-breastfeeding-infographics/en/) at their resource about pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding.

## Rainbow Doula DC

This week, I interviewed Kelsey Carroll, a doula and the founder of [Rainbow Doula](https://www.rainbowdouladc.com/) in DC, on the [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/pregnancy-and-birth-during-the-covid-19-crisis/) podcast. Kelsey's doula collective is committed to providing doula support for birth and beyond, regardless of a person's sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or marital status. Since COVID-19 set in, Rainbow Doula has shifted to offer more virtual services and online classes. Not only can you continue to work with them one-on-one right now, but you can join their [online classes](https://www.rainbowdouladc.com/events), like [DIY Doula](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/diy-doula-preparing-partners-for-birth-may-tickets-103968624956?aff=Website). 

## Other Doulas

According to [DONA International](https://www.dona.org/what-is-a-doula/) a doula is "a trained professional who provides continuous physical, emotional and informational support to a mother before, during and shortly after childbirth to help her achieve the healthiest, most satisfying experience possible".  We should all have this type of experience, no matter what, but during a pandemic, it's even more important! If you aren't in DC, or if you'd just like to research all your options, there are tons of other doulas and doula collectives out there. In the DC area alone, a quick search brings up:

* [DC Birth Doulas](https://dcbirthdoulas.com/)

* [Doulas of Prince George's County](http://www.doulasofpgcounty.com/)

* [Doulas of Capitol Hill](http://www.doulasofcapitolhill.com/)

## Birthing Bill of Rights

One really helpful thing that I learned about during my conversation with Kelsey Carroll this week was the [birthing bill of rights](http://karenmelton.com/articles/the-pregnant-patients-bill-of-rights/). It's exactly what it sounds like. It's a list of all of the rights that you have as a birthing person. This will come in very handy when you're in the hospital (or elsewhere) in labor. Knowledge is power, and this list of rights will give you the information that you need to understand what your rights are as a birthing person.

## Evidence-Based Birth

Another wonderful resource that Kelsey shared with me is [Evidencebasedbirth.com](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/). They even have a page completely dedicated to [COVID-19 resources](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/covid19/). 

## Your Medical Provider

Of course, one of the best resources at all times, not just during a pandemic, is your own medical provider. Reach out to your obstetrician or primary care doctor and ask them what precautions you should be taking right now. Reach out to the hospital you plan to give birth at and ask them what precautions they are taking and what changes you can expect if you go into labor during the quarantine. These providers know your medical history, and they know the updates they are implementing themselves, so they are some of the best resources out there.

If you are currently pregnant and expecting your child soon, my heart is with you. Bringing a life into the world is already a huge life experience, and a global pandemic makes it even more intense and uncertain. It's okay to be scared and nervous, and there are lots of resources out there to support you. Good luck!
