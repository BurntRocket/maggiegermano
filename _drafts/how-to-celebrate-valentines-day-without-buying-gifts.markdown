It's almost Valentine's Day! That means you're being inundated with ads from companies that sell diamonds, flowers, chocolates, and more. It also means you're probably feeling pressured or tempted to buy something for a loved one that you may or may not be able to afford. Plus, as I wrote about at the holidays, maybe you or your loved ones don't really want to give or receive physical gifts. Well, I have some good news for you: you can celebrate Valentine's Day (and any other special day) without buying expensive gifts. Here's how:

## Make a Meal

One of my favorite things to do is have friends over to my house for a meal. It can be dinner or brunch, it doesn't really matter. The important part is that we're taking the time to be together. I actually enjoy this more than going to a restaurant for a meal, because we can whatever we want and drink as much as we want, and we don't have to worry about the bill being too high. 

If you want to show your loved ones how much you care about them, but you don't have the budget for a fancy restaurant, make them a meal! If you want to make it even more special, find out what their favorite dishes are and surprise them with those. 

## Bake Cookies

I don't know about you, but I love getting containers filled with tasty treats around the holidays. 

## Write a Card

Even more than a thoughtful gift, I love receiving thoughtful, handwritten cards in the mail. I also love sending them. It's an opportunity to really be honest about how grateful you are to have someone in your life.
