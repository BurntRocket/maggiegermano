**Sandy Smith:**

I am a personal finance influencer focused on improving the lives of the underprivileged. In 2009 I founded the award nominated blog, [Yes I Am Cheap](https://yesiamcheap.com/) which helps people save money, get out of debt and improve their income so that they can live their best financial lives.

In 2013, recognizing that people of color had not benefited from the recovery of the great recession, I reached out to my friends in finance to help me raise awareness about the plight of people of color. We created [Colorful Money Magazine](http://colorful.money/) and formed the Elevate Mastermind which helps financial influencers of color better reach the audience that we serve. The mastermind has over 45 members including Tiffany Aliche, Jason Vitug and Patrice Cunningham Washington – all of whom serve on the steering committee the Elevate Influencer conference, the first of which was held in 2019.

Since I clearly was not busy, I formed the Hustle Crew in 2015 which helps my audience identify ways to make extra money that they can dedicate towards debt servicing or just living a more financially fulfilled life. There are nearly 10,000 members of that group which is more than 90% female.
