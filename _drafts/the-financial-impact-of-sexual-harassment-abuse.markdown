Happy Women's History Month! This is the one month out of the year that is dedicated to celebrating the contributions and achievements of women in America. Like with Black History Month, we should be celebrating women every day. But unfortunately, that's not the case (yet), so it's nice to take advantage of this month to elevate women and the issues affecting them.

Sexual harassment and abuse have been prominent in the news lately, thanks to the #MeToo movement. Not only do these crimes affect women emotionally and physically, but they have a financial impact as well. Unfortunately, there isn't a ton of research on this yet (and hopefully there will be soon). But based on my own

## Healthcare Costs

## Mental Health Repercussions

## Changing Industries

I've heard about this a lot during the #MeToo movement. Many women who started out in the entertainment industry left their career after experiencing sexual harassment or abuse in the workplace.

## Litigation

In the news, we often hear about multi-million dollar settlements. But the truth is, that usually doesn't happen. If it does happen, it is after much time, money, and struggle.
