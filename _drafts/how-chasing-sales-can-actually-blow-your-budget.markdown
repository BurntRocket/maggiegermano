The holidays are upon us! As I mentioned in my [last post](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-create-a-holiday-gift-budget/), we've been inundated with ads for weeks or months by now. There are hundreds of sales and special offers enticing us to buy. Do you ever find yourself spending more than planned even after you take advantage of the many sales opportunities? You're not alone. According to a [recent survey](https://www.newmiddleclass.org/blog/2017/11/13/holiday-spending-traps-how-us-consumers-get-through-holidays/) from [Elevate's](https://www.elevate.com/home.html) [Center for the New Middle Class](https://www.newmiddleclass.org/blog/), you're not alone.

Almost 40 percent of American consumers reported overspending on the holidays in 2016. Plus, debt counseling companies see a [25 percent increase](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=88539) in customers looking for support in January and February. But it doesn't have to be this way. We can learn from our mistakes, and make new decisions moving forward.

## What the data says about shopping and chasing sales

* 39 percent of consumers spend more than planned during the holidays

* Those who went over budget spend about 15 percent more than planned

* 86 percent of shoppers use some kind of savings tactic, like shopping sales

* Consumers were 45 percent more likely to go over budget if they chased sales

* People who use coupons were 22 percent more likely to overspend

* Couponers who didn't set a budget were 76 percent more likely to overspend than those who did budget

* Using a credit or debt card made people 38 percent more likely to overspend than those who used cash

* 58 percent of holiday spending goes towards gifts, while the rest accounts for travel, food, celebrations, etc.

* Those who didn't plan ahead spend 125 percent (!) more than those who stuck to their plan

## What you can do to avoid overspending at the holidays

**Create a budget**

I wrote about this [last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-create-a-holiday-gift-budget/), but it's so key to create a spending budget at the holidays. Make sure you're also accounting for any travel (or celebrating) that you will have to do. This will give you a framework to stay within. 

**Set spending limits**

Once you've created your budget, set a cap on how much you can spend per person or per gift. Keep track of your spending as you go, and stick to your limits. 

**Plan for unexpected costs**

Things happen. If your car breaks down or something else goes wrong around the holidays, it only adds stress to you and your budget. It helps to plan for these types of expenses. Make it a long-term goal to build up your [emergency savings](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/you-need-an-emergency-fund) account. This fund will protect you when unexpected costs arise. 

**Avoid savings traps**

Have you ever gone to the store looking for one item, but then there's a sale if you buy two or more? So then you end up buying more (and therefore spending more) than you intended? Me too! That's called a "savings trap". It seems like you're saving money but you're actually spending more than you would have otherwise. Once you have your gift list and/or budget set, don't deviate, even if there is a sale.

**Use cash**

If you tend to overspend even when you have a budget, consider using cash only. Once you set a spending limit for yourself, take that amount out of your bank account. Carry that with you when doing your holiday shopping, and once it's gone, you're done!  Consider leaving your credit cards at home so you aren't tempted to keep shopping.
