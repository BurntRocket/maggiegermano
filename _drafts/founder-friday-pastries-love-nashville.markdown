Happy Friday! What did you get up to this week? For me, it was a week mixed with love, pleasure, tragedy, and anger. It seems like that's how every week (or even every day) is lately. I hope you're taking care of yourself. 

## How I Earned Money This Week

* Two clients' monthly payments went through this week.

* We got our first [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21754745) guest! We've had so many people sign up that we're wondering if we're charging too low for the space.

* I got a new one-time session client!

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I are trying out the [Flat Belly Diet](https://www.amazon.com/Flat-Belly-Diet-Liz-Vaccariello/dp/1250013356) this week, so we spend a hefty sum on groceries on Sunday. It was about $150, but we won't be going out to eat at all, so it'll be worth it.

* To pre-empt our attempts at flat bellies, we had an early Valentine's Day date at [Le Diplomate](http://lediplomatedc.com/). **Bonus:** we used a gift card that my parents sent Dan as a congratulations on his promotion. French pastries taste so much better when they're free.

* I bought Dan, our friend Chaz, and myself tickets to the [Vagina Monologues](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/eve-enslers-vagina-monologues-tickets-42406034591?aff=efbeventtix) for this Saturday. This is such an important play, and I encourage you to go see it! 

* I'll be donating to a nonprofit that is fighting against gun violence. I'm still doing some research on which organization to choose, but here are some contenders: [Everytown for Gun Safety](https://everytown.org/), [Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence](http://www.bradycampaign.org/), [Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America](https://momsdemandaction.org/), and the [Coalition to Stop Gun Violence](https://www.csgv.org/). Please give what you can. We can't go on like this.

## What I'm Writing

Wednesday was Valentine's Day, and just in time, a study came out about money and relationships. Read [my piece](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/stop-fighting-about-money-with-your-valentine/) about how to stop fighting with your beau about money.

## What I'm Excited About

* I finally painted our kitchen cabinets (well the upper ones)! We got our butcher block counters installed right when we moved in, and they've severely clashed with the dark brown cabinets. We aren't financially ready to get new cabinets, so I knew we had to go through the painting process instead. I'd been avoiding it because it's a lot of work but I finally gave in on Sunday while Dan was finishing up the backsplash. They look 1000x better!

* The [February Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/money-something-to-talk-about/) gathering is next week! Join us on Wednesday, February 21st to discuss how to better communicate with our loved ones about money. It can be a really tricky subject, but we can help you do it better!

## What I'm Fan-Girling Over

* How did I just get into *[Nashville](http://abc.go.com/shows/nashville)* this past weekend?? I knew Connie Britton was missing from my life. I finally started the show from the beginning and I'm obsessed. It has just enough drama, hot men, and country music. #TeamDeacon

* Keep an eye out for the new [Bossed Up](https://bossedup.org/) podcast! [Emilie Aries](https://emiliearies.com/) is leaving the [Stuff Mom Never Told You](https://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/) podcast to pursue this new venture and I can't wait to listen!

## Money Tips to Take Into the Weekend

* Do you typically buy a lot of take out over the weekend? Plan ahead to prevent that! Map out what you want to eat this weekend and go to the grocery store on your way home from work. That way, you'll have plenty of delicious food around the house and you won't be as tempted to go buy prepared food.

* Find a fun, free activity to do with a friend. In DC? Go to a Smithsonian museum! I'm personally planning to see the new exhibit at the [Hirshhorn](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/). It's both free and will help me be more cultured. Other ideas include: hiking, going for a long walk, watching a movie together at home, and cooking a meal together.
