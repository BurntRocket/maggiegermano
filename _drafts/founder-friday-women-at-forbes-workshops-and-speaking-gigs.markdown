Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my clients' monthly payments went through.

* A new client signed up for a one-time coaching session.

* We had guests stay in our Airbnb for most of the week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Hoo boy, this was a big wedding spending week. We ordered our wedding invitations (!!!), which was a bigger expense than I wanted it to be (check out my post about that). We received them on Wednesday and they are so beautiful! I can't wait for our guests to see them. Dan ordered his suit, which hopefully won't need alterations. We ordered two shirts from Nordstrom to see which one he likes best. If you don't already know, Nordstrom has a great return policy! I'm also trying to check a bunch of little things off my list, so I ordered some random items for the wedding, including some decorations and gifts for the bridal party.

* We also spent a whole lot of money on our honeymoon this week! I am too excited to be stressed about that, though. Plus, we have a travel savings account where we are pulling all of that money from, so it isn't coming out of our normal budget. We booked our lodging in Chiang Mai and Bangkok, we booked our visit to the [Elephant Jungle Sanctuary](https://elephantjunglesanctuary.com/) (!!!), and we booked our travel from Bangkok to Koh Lipe and then from Koh Lipe to Chiang Mai. We plan to book most of our other tours when we're already there. It's getting really real!

* Last night, Dan and I went to [the Anthem](https://www.theanthemdc.com/) for the first time. We saw [Sylvan Esso](http://www.sylvanesso.com/) in concert. It was a delayed anniversary gift from me to him. To make a real date of it, we went to [Kaliwa](https://www.kaliwadc.com/home/) for dinner. It was delicious!

* I also got my hair cut yesterday for the first time in six months. As some of you may know, I used to have really short hair, even having one side shaved for a while. I decided to grow it out quite a bit in preparation for my wedding in November, but I got really sick of it! It was the longest it had been in almost four years. So I went and got it cut and it's quite a bit shorter than I planned. We'll see how I feel about it once I get used to it!

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about [unemployment benefits](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/should-you-file-for-unemployment/) and when you may or may not qualify for them. If you've recently been laid off, make sure you check it out!

## **What I’m Up To**

* I'm holding my first official workshop! On Saturday, September 15th, we'll be gathering at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/) in Petworth, DC to learn how to budget! Sign up for the [Making & Breaking the Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) workshop today!

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/) is planned and ready for registration! We’ll be focusing on homebuying for first-timers, and we’ll be joined by the wonderful real estate agent (and dear friend) [Liz Delgado-Steo](https://www.realliving.com/elizabeth-delgado-steo). Liz is great at breaking down the homebuying process into language you can understand, so this is a meetup you can’t miss!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I'm speaking at Robert Morris University next month! There was a last minute cancelation at one of their orientation events, so I'm filling in. I'm hoping to do more events like this, because it's important to get your money right from a young age, and I want to reach women in college! So if you know of any universities who are looking for money experts, [let me know](mailto:boss@maggiegermano.com). 

* I'm heading up to Syracuse this afternoon for my bridal shower. I can't wait to see my family! It also happens to be my dad's 60th birthday, so I'm excited to be there to celebrate.

* I can officially announce that I'm a new contributor over at [Women@Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/)! I will have my own column where I will share my tips and advice about how to get your money right. Check out my first post about [how to trick yourself into a budget](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2018/07/25/how-to-trick-yourself-into-sticking-to-a-budget/), and click "follow" on my [author page](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/#37ea97a87556) so you always know when I'm publishing!

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

![It feels really natural to want to avoid your money problems. But that doesn't make them go away. In fact, it makes them even worse. So open up that bill that's been sitting on your counter. Call the creditor back.

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
