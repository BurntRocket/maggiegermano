Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* Our Airbnb has been pretty booked recently! We had guests all week and a new guest is arriving tomorrow.

* Dan got his bi-weekly paycheck today.

* A former ongoing coaching client signed up and paid to have me on retainer.

* The March Money Circle gathering was this past Wednesday. I don't use [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) as a major source of income, but it is a way for me to break even on the event itself. *(Would you sign up to be a virtual Money Circle member if you could get video access to the events, along with other resources? Leave a comment or [email me](mailto:boss@maggiegermano.com) if you're interested!)*

## How I Spent Money This Week

* We spent money on our usual weekly grocery run. 

* Dan and I attended the trivia night at the Hyattsville [Pizzeria Paradiso](https://www.eatyourpizza.com/) on Tuesday. We'd never been to it before, but neither of us had other plans, so we decided to make it our date night this week. Trivia was free, but we each got a pizza and a couple beers. 

* I had coffee with a dear friend on Wednesday so that we could catch up after a while. I also had lunch with a different friend on the same day for the same reason.

* I bought some snacks for my trip to Vermont tonight. I will also be spending some money on dinner and wine once I get there. 

## What I’m Writing

* This week, on [my blog](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-money-stress-affects-women-249369/), I wrote about how money stress affects women. 

* I wrote a [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2019/03/27/women-are-working-more-than-ever-but-they-still-take-on-most-household-responsibilities/#6253db9a52e9) piece for Women's History Month about how women are still shouldering most household responsibilities in addition to work. If you're not already following [my column](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano), do it today so you never miss a piece!

## What I’m Up To

* The [April Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-honoring-self-care-keeping-your-pockets-full-tickets-59004572264) meet up is ready for registration! We’ll be joined by Megan Sanchez of Upswing Health Coaching to talk about prioritizing self-care while on a budget.

* My friend and real estate agent, [Liz Ho](https://www.rlahre.com/agent/liz-ho/), and I are hosting a buyer's salon in DC on Wednesday, April 24th. Keep your eyes peeled, because we'll be sharing the sign-up link soon!

* I want to hear from you! As I am continuing to create blog content and expanding my work into online courses, a podcast, and more workshops, I want to make sure I’m creating things that are useful to YOU. I’ve made a survey for my clients and readers to hear about what you most want to learn about.

## What I'm Excited About

* I'm going to Vermont this weekend! In fact, I'm definitely at the airport right now, getting ready to board my flight. It's for my friend's bachelorette party, and I can't wait to spend the weekend with a bunch of awesome ladies!

* I'm signed up to attend [Statement](https://www.statementevent.co/), a gathering of women in money. I'm so excited to be part of a group of women who I am inspired by. If you'll be in NYC from May 2-5, let me know!

* Dan, our puppy Bruno, and I are starting obedience training on Monday! Raising a puppy has been a lot harder than I ever expected, so I'm excited to get some support and guidance from experts! Plus, maybe this will help Bruno to stop biting us.
