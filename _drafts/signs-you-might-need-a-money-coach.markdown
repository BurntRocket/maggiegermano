January is often used as the month to [reflect](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/reflecting-on-2017/) on the previous year and [set goals](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/easy-financial-goals-for-2018/) and intentions for the coming one. It's a good time to pause and make any desired changes. If you're very lucky, you feel completely equipped to pursue these goals on your own. But if you're like most of us, you'll find that you need support along the way. As my friend, [Jess Lyons](http://jessicaleighlyons.com/), said to me recently: "If I learned anything last year, it is that the work I want to do does not happen alone. Co-creation is where it's at."

And it's so true! It's easy to think that we have to go after what we want on our own. We live in an individualist culture. But, we can and *should* lean on each other in order to reach our goals. Otherwise, we'll end up exhausted and we'll feel alone. That's no way to live, and it won't result in satisfying success. So! If you're hoping to take strides in your financial life this year, you might need the support of a coach. If you struggle with any of the issues I list below, you probably need some extra guidance.

## You Avoid Your Money

Have you ever tossed bills to the side, left unopened for days, weeks, months? Do you avoid looking at your bank statement like it's the plague? Do you know that you have debt, but you don't know how much, because you're afraid to look at it?

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, you likely use avoidance as a coping mechanism when it comes to money. There is nothing to be ashamed of; we all cope in different ways. But ignoring something, even for months, does not actually make it go away. This is especially true with money. In fact, avoiding your finances can lead to interest charges, late fees, and even bills sent to collections.

If this is your go-to response to money problems, it's probably hard for you to change it yourself. You may need the accountability and nudging from an outside part to help you face things.

## You Feel Ashamed of Your Finances

It's easy to equate net worth with self worth. It's a major conflation in our society. "Poor people must have some kind of moral failing and rich people must be inherently deserving." We see this play out in our politics everyday. But it's not right, and it's not true.  

However, being inundated with these messages from a young age makes it hard to shake off the shame. And shame leads to paralysis and isolation. The more ashamed you feel, the less likely you are to take positive action. You're also less likely to ask for help when you need it. So you end up trapped in a cycle where you're ashamed of your financial situation, but you're unable to make any changes. In fact, the more ashamed you are, the worse your finances may become.

Does this resonate with you? If it does, you probably could use some outside support. 

## You Spend Money to Deal with Your Emotions

This is so, so common. Many (most?) of us turn to spending in order to fill a void or cope with a negative emotion. We even spend money to celebrate a positive emotion. This coping mechanism is not inherently bad! But if we use it too often, it can lead to overspending, and ultimately debt.

## You Don't Know What Your Goals Are

It's okay to not know what you want to achieve. In fact, I think January can be tough for those of us who are unclear about our future and our desires. We see people all around us making resolutions and setting goals, so it's natural to feel confused and left out.

## You Don't Want to Talk to Loved Ones About Money

As I'm sure you know, if you're reading this, money is a touchy subject. There is a lot of perceived and real judgment. This makes it extra hard to talk about money with the people who love us. Our loved ones have an emotional investment in our lives and choices. They also might have a financial stake in our decisions, good or bad.

If you're dealing with any of these struggles, I know it probably feels insurmountable. But you're not alone! There are many resources out there: blogs, books, courses, and coaches.
