counselor has access to local scholarships

where do you keep the scholarships? 

- online?

- in a binder?

- bulletin board?

- email?

you don't have to do something in order to get this

you get it and it's yours as a gift

## Scholarships

You can apply for scholarships throughout your career

often and early

as young as 13 years old - get it when you graduate

you have to earn this; do something for it

what are the scholarships that come around each year? find out the year before and get a copy. what questions are they asking?
