Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* On Monday, I spoke on a panel at the Women at the Wheel event put on by Prudential. It was a paid event.

* Two of my ongoing clients paid for their monthly fee.

* A new client paid for their one-time coaching session. 

* We had an Airbnb guest stay with us this entire week.

* Dan's bi-weekly paycheck came in today. 

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Since Dan and I discovered that our movie theater sells $6 tickets on Tuesdays, we have been trying to go to the movies on Tuesday evenings when we don't have other commitments. This week, we went to see X-Men: Dark Phoenix. I adore the X-Men franchise and was excited to see Sophie Turner as the lead in this film. Unfortunately, the movie was pretty bad, and I wouldn't really recommend it.

## What I’m Up To

* The [June Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-visualizing-your-money-goals-tickets-62153044429) is up and available for registration! At this event, we’ll be visualizing our money goals so that they’re more motivating and easier to track. See you there?

* I’ve been hinting at starting a podcast for a while now. But in order to make sure the podcast is interesting and helpful for YOU, I want to make sure I’m answering your questions. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit any and all money questions that you have!

## What I'm Excited About

* This week, I discovered a podcast called [By The Book](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/stitcher/by-the-book) with [Jolenta Greenberg](http://www.jolentagreenberg.com/) and [Kristen Meinzer](https://www.kristenmeinzer.com/). For each episode, they read a different self help book and life by the teachings for two weeks and then report back. It's really enlightening and also very funny. I recommend it!

## What I’m Reading

I'm still reading  ***[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power?from_search=true)*** by Naomi Alderman, but I also just started *[Red, White, and Royal Blue](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41150487-red-white-royal-blue)* by Casey McQuiston since it's the June pick for my book club. It's fun so far and I can't wait to dig in more.
