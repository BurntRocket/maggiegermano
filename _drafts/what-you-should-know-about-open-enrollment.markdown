Open enrollment season began on November 1st! This is the period of the year when Americans can enroll in a health insurance plan for the following year. Typically, the enrollment period is about 90 days long, but this year it's only 45 days. This doesn't give you a ton of time to do research before enrolling, so start now!

There's a lot of misinformation out there about health insurance and enrollment. So here are some facts to get you on the right page. 

1. The Affordable Care Act is still alive and well. Congress has held several repeal votes this year, but none have succeeded. The marketplace is still available for 2018 and the regulations are still in place.

2. Open enrollment for 2018 is from November 1st until December 15th. You **must** enroll by December 15th in order to be covered for 2018.

3. 80% of people in [HealthCare.gov](http://www.healthcare.gov) states can find a plan for less than $75/month, up from 71% last year, more people than ever before.

4. 100% of U.S. counties have an insurer offering health insurance coverage, despite what you may have read on Twitter.

5. 70% of counties have at least two insurance issuers, meaning consumers have multiple plans to choose from in nearly every county in America. Some consumers will even have access to insurance with zero dollar premiums depending on age and income.

6. Premiums are upwards of 130% increased on the Silver plans but Bronze and Gold plans offer plans at no-cost or low-cost. Many people will be eligible for plans for $0, $10, $20 a month. In fact, 8/10 people are eligible for a plan that is less than $75 a month. Compare that to what you're spending now!
