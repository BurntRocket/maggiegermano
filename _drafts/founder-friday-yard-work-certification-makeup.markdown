## How I Earned Money This Week

* One of my monthly clients' payment went through on Monday

* We have a family staying in our Airbnb for four nights, and their payment went through today.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* This was another rough week on the homeowner side of things. On Monday and Tuesday, we had a ton of insulation installed in the attic, closets, and basement. We had an energy audit done a couple months ago and it found that our house was pretty inefficient, which we definitely could feel all winter. In preparation for the hot summer, we had insulation put in, which will hopefully keep us more comfortable and keep our energy costs down. Luckily, we're getting a nice rebate from Pepco for doing energy upgrades, but it was still a big expense to pull from savings. I'm hoping it's worth it.

* In addition to that, we had a pre-emptive termite treatment done around the perimeter of our house. To prepare, we had to hire a junk hauling company to come and remove all of the construction materials the former owners left stored under our front porch. Since we already had the guys coming over, we had them take a massive pile of yard waste we'd collected after doing quite a bit of work cleaning things up in our back yard. That was definitely the type of expense that was worth it and I will absolutely consider in the future.

* On Tuesday, I applied to become certified by the [International Coach Federation](https://coachfederation.org/) (ICF). I'm already a Certified Professional Diversity Coach with [CoachDiversity Institute](http://coachdiversity.com/), but ICF is internationally recognized as the organization that officially certifies coaches. It's an expensive fee to apply for certification, but I have all the qualifications, and I'm hoping this puts me ahead of the curve when it comes to the coaching industry and the regulations that are sure to come eventually.

* On Wednesday, I had lunch with my dear friend and fantastic real estate agent, [Liz Delgado-Steo](mailto:lizdsrealestate@gmail.com). We tried to be healthy and I had a delicious quinoa bowl at Pret.

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about [retirement accounts](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-retirement-accounts/) and the differences between many of the options out there. If you're confused about retirement savings, check it out!

## What I’m Excited About

* Tonight is the [Being Boss book launch party](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/being-boss-dc-book-launch-party-tickets-43800308903) in DC! I'm sponsoring the event, along with a bunch of other fantastic businesses and individuals. I've been listening to the [Being Boss](https://beingboss.club/) podcast since I first started my business 2 years ago, and I can't wait to dig into the book.

* I tried Zumba for the first time this week. I felt like I had never danced before in my life and had no rhythm. But it was also a lot of fun and a fantastic workout. I can't wait to try it again soon!

* Dan and I are finally going to the [National Museum of African American History & Culture](https://nmaahc.si.edu/) this weekend. We got timed tickets from his office, and plan to spend many hours exploring the museum.
