## How I Earned Money This Week

## How I Spent Money This Week

## What I’m Writing

For the month of June, I'm writing blog posts about questions I've been asked by clients and [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) members. This week, I wrote about what your options are for [student loan debt consolidation](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-are-my-options-for-student-loan-consolidation/). I hope it helps!

## What I’m Excited About

## What I’m Up To

* The [June Money Circle meetup](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-make-a-budget/) is on June 20th! We’ll be gathering to talk about budgeting basics and we'll create our own budgets. I’ll be there to guide you and answer your questions. Join us!

* I’m teaming up with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/mo-money-mo-worries-get-financially-savvy-in-2018/washington-dc/49127) on Tuesday, June 26th for a free personal finance workshop in Navy Yard. See you there?
