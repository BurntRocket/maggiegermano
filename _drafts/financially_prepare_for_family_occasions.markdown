I have a pretty big family. My mom has five sisters, my dad has two brothers, and between all of them, there are about 18 cousins. Plus, my cousins (and sisters) have started having their own kids! When there are that many people involved, there can be a lot of family occasions each year. Weddings, birthdays, baby showers, holidays, etc. Now that I live far away from my family, it can be difficult to get home for everything. In fact, sometimes it's downright impossible. But if you value your family as much as I do, it's likely a top priority for you to get home as much as you can.

All that being said, I also believe that you should not have to spend all your money or go into debt to see your family. 

save each month

pick and choose

meet in between

One of my cousins lives near Philadelphia, which is about two hours from DC, and about four hours from where my sisters live. We've recently talked about possibly meeting up in Philadelphia for a cousins weekend, because it's *almost* in between for the majority of us. It's impossible to please everyone when you're planning a trip, but you can try to compromise.
