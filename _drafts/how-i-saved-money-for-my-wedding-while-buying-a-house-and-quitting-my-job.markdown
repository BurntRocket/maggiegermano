If you've been following me at all in the past year, you know I've been going through a lot of changes. I got engaged, I bought a house, and I quit my day job. These are all very financially risky and stressful changes to make, especially all at once!

## I Saved Over 10% of a Windfall

In July 2017, I received a large sum of money as a settlement from the Department of Health and Human Services. In December 2015, I got a routine flu shot at CVS so that I wouldn't risk giving the flu to my then-newborn nephew over Christmas. Within an hour, my shoulder hurt so badly that I couldn't lift my arm. I had never gotten the flu shot before, so I figured it was a normal reaction to the shot. Well, I was wrong. I could barely lift my left arm for six months. Dan had to help me get dressed and even take off my jacket. It took over a year, an MRI and CT scan, and many doctors telling me I was crazy, but eventually, I received a settlement from the government for my injury.

## We Saved Our Tax Returns

Since Dan and I were both fully employed in 2017, we both received tax refunds in April. 

## I Saved All My Business Income

For the first four months of 2018, I saved all of my business profit and put it directly into our wedding savings account.
