## How I Earned Money This Week

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I spent Sunday and Monday in Frederick, MD. We spent most of our money on a cute bed and breakfast and an all-you-can-eat crab feast. But we did go to a few antique shops to poke around. I bought a couple small gifts, but otherwise the prices were much higher than we anticipated. 

* I spent over $300 on donuts yesterday. Not kidding! We're having donuts instead of cake for our wedding, and we confirmed and paid for our order. I can't wait to see $150 donuts set up at the wedding reception.
