## How I Earned Money This Week

* One of my monthly clients' payments went through on Sunday.

* We have two different guests staying in our Airbnb this week and weekend.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* I spent Tuesday in the city for [Solopreneur Circle](https://www.solopreneurcircle.com/) (yay!). I didn't plan my schedule very well, nor did I pack a lunch, so I ended up buying a small pizza from [Pizzeria Vetri](https://www.pizzeriavetri.com/).

* I'm trying my darnedest to make our first floor bathroom look not terrible. I've been repainting the walls this week, but I also wanted all new matching hardware. So I bought a set of oil-rubbed bronze bathroom accessories. I can't wait to hang them up!

* We finally ordered our save-the-dates for our wedding! I personally wanted to have them mailed out weeks ago, but such is life. The postcards themselves will only cost around $50, but then we spent about $30 on stamps. Not too shabby for a wedding product that can cost much more than that. (I'm afraid to see how much our invitations will cost, though.)

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about the one number budgeting method. 

## What I’m Excited About

## What I'm Up To

* I'm this week's guest on [Popcorn Finance](https://popcornfinance.com/episode-055-taking-your-side-hustle-full-time-with-maggie-germano/)! Chris and I talked about how my business started as a side hustle and went to my full-time job. Take a listen and let me know what you think!

* [Money Circle is next Wednesday, April 25th!](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-deal-with-credit-card-debt/) We'll be talking about credit card debt and how to start making moves to get out of it. Don't worry if you're stressed or ashamed of your debt, Money Circle is a safe space where we can support each other and break the taboos around money. I hope to [see you there](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-deal-with-credit-card-debt/)!
