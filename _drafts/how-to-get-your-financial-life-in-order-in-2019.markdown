## Decide What You Want to Achieve

What is the number one financial goal you want to reach in 2019? 

## Get Clear on Your Numbers

## Schedule Weekly Check-Ins

I call it a Money Minute, you can call it whatever you want. The most important thing is to do it. Schedule at least one time each week to check in with your money. It can literally be 10 minutes where you see how much you've spent that week and compare it to what's available to you for the month. It doesn't have to be terribly complicated or painful. In fact, the more you do it, the less painful and more helpful it will actually be. 

## Choose One Monthly Expense to Eliminate

## Open a High-Yield Savings Account

## Automate Your Savings

## Increase (Or Begin) Your Retirement Contribution
