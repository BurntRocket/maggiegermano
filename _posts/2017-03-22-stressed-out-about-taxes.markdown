You're not alone!

According to the IRS, early tax return volume was down by 33% compared to last year. There could be a few reasons for that, including the later deadline (April 18 vs. April 15). But I think there is often a lot more to it than just deadlines. Personally, I put off doing my taxes for over a month longer than I usually do, because I knew I had to include my business expenses and earnings. I felt intimidated and was worried that I would do it wrong. So I put it off. Turns out, it took a little extra time, but I got through it, and got a pretty great refund check!

I put out the call to my Money Circle folks, and asked them why they've put off doing their taxes. The responses were pretty consistent.

## "I knew I'd owe."

A couple people responded saying that they knew they'd owe money on their taxes this year. They weren't necessarily putting off filing in order to avoid paying, but they wanted to be able to save up the money first.

## "I was waiting to receive all my documents."
