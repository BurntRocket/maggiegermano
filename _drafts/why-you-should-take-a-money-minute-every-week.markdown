If you're in the [Money Circle Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MoneyCircleGroup), or if you're one of my [coaching clients](https://www.maggiegermano.com/coaching/), you know that I tell people to take a minute minute at least once a week.

One of the most common excuses I hear about managing a budget is that it is too time consuming.

After that, it shouldn't take you very long to check in and update your budget every week. That's because you only have a week of spending to track, rather than months or years. So the more often you check in with your money, the faster it'll be!
