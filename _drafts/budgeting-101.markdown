*The blog theme this month is budgeting!*

I want to start off by saying that, sadly, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to budgeting. People often ask me what budget template they should use, or how much they should be spending or saving. There's no easy answer because it always depends on the individual. It depends on your current circumstances, your long-term goals, and your personality. BUT once you figure out a budget that suits you, you'll be much better off. Let's dig in.

## 1. Figure out how much you earn each month

This one can be easy, if you have a steady paycheck. All you have to do is look at your paystubs that come each month.

## 2. Figure out how much you spend each month

This part can be a little trickier and tedious. First, I would break this into two different categories: fixed/required expenses and flex spending.

An easier way of doing this is to create an account with an app like ClarityMoney, Learnvest, Mint, etc. Link all of your accounts and the program will give you a breakdown of how you've been spending your money over time. You might have to go in and re-categorize some things, but this should give you a good idea of how much you're spending and on what.

## 3. Don't forget about non-monthly expenses

Quarterly or annual expenses can be easy to forget. And they can throw you off your budget if you aren't prepared. So keep track of all of your non-monthly expenses. Put reminders in your calendar for right before you'll be charged for them. This exercise might even show that there are subscriptions or other bills you should cancel.

## 4. Figure out how much is left over

## 5. Identify where you can cut spending

## 6. Readjust as needed
