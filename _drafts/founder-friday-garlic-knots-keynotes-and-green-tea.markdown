Happy Friday! Has anyone else had just awful allergies this week? My eyes don't want to be open at all. Thanks, pollen. Anyway, here's what I was up to this week!

## How I Earned Money This Week

No client payments went through this week, but we had three different sets of Airbnb guests! We're actually thinking of increasing our nightly fee, and seeing if we'll still get booked as often. We started our fee fairly low because we weren't sure how popular the location would be. Now that we were booked up for May and June, it might be worth revisiting the price.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* On Sunday, we went to Home Depot for the first time in a few weeks. We bought a ceiling fan for the dining room (and now we might have to hire an electrician because the light isn't working).

* On Wednesday, I went into the city and worked at a coffee shop. On Wednesday night, I went to see author [Roxane Gay](http://www.roxanegay.com/) speak at [Sixth & I](https://www.sixthandi.org/). Beforehand, I met a friend at [Farmers & Distillers](https://farmersanddistillers.com/) and I had an order of garlic knots. (So. Good.)

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about what you should do if you get [sued by a creditor](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-do-i-do-if-i-get-sued-by-a-creditor/). If you're in this situation, don't miss out on this piece!

## What I’m Excited About

* I was asked to do a "keynote-ish" speech at a university next spring! It's not a done deal, and it's a far way off, but it's still an exciting prospect! I'm actually trying to do more speaking gigs, so I can reach more people with my thoughts on money and women's empowerment. Interested in having me speak at your organization? Email me at [hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com)!

* I’m offering** [20% off one-time financial coaching sessions](https://maggiegermanofinancialcoaching.as.me/onetimediscount) **in the month of June! We’re halfway through 2018, and this is usually the time we realize we haven’t made progress on our goals for the year. If you want some help getting back on track with your finances, let’s talk!

## What I’m Up To

* The **[June Money Circle meetup](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-make-a-budget/)** is on June 20th! We’ll be gathering to talk about budgeting basics and we’ll create our own budgets. I’ll be there to guide you and answer your questions. Join us!

* I’m teaming up with **[General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/mo-money-mo-worries-get-financially-savvy-in-2018/washington-dc/49127)** on Tuesday, June 26th for a free personal finance workshop in Navy Yard. See you there?
