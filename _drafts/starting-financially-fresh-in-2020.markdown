## Automate Your Savings

As I told a dear friend yesterday, the only way to really make sure that you're saving money is to automate it. 

## Put Your Credit Card Away

If you struggle with overspending or have credit card debt that you're trying to pay off once and for all, there's really only one way to get back on track. You have to stop using your credit card. I'm sorry, but it's true! The more you continue to use your credit card, the more you're increasing your balance and interest charges. It also acts as a crutch if you're prone to overspending. It allows you to spend more than you can actually afford. So if you're trying to pay off debt, or even if you're just trying to teach yourself how to live within your means, you have to put your credit card away and stop using it. 

If you're like me and you have a lock box at home, put your credit cards in there. If you want to pay off the card and never use it again, you can cut it into pieces so that you can't use it anymore. Other options might be literally freezing it into a block of ice so that it's too difficult to get to. Or, more simply, give it to a trusted friend or family member who can hold it for you. But now that we live in a digital world, it's also important to remove your credit card number from online stores. Log into your Amazon, Lyft or Uber, and Sephora accounts and replace your credit card with your debit card. Or better yet, don't put any payment method in, because then you'll be forced to type it in whenever you want to shop, making yourself think twice before making a purchase.
