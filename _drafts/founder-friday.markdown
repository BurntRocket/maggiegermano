## How I Earned Money This Week

* None of my clients' payments went through this week, so all my earnings are from Airbnb!

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Three monthly subscription payments for my business went through this week, and I also spent some money on snacks for Money Circle, as well as a Lyft home from the event.

* On Sunday, Dan and I drove to Leesburg, Virginia to see our friend and wedding officiant, who was in town for a wedding. We went to [Vanish Farmwood Brewery](https://vanishbeer.com/) for a few hours and had some beer and too much food.
