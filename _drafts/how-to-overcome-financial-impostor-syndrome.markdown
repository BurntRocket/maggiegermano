One of the number one problems that my coaching clients have is financial impostor syndrome. Impostor syndrome is "a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a 'fraud'". This is often talked about in terms of career and feeling like we don't deserve our success. 

As for financial impostor syndrome, I've seen it show up in many ways.

## Forgive Yourself

We all make mistakes. I'm sure everyone in the world has something in their past that they regret and wish they'd done differently.

## Learn the Truth About Others

If you've ever received an end-of-year letter from a distant friend of the family, you know that people have been sharing their highlight reels since before social media came around. But social media makes it a lot easier to make our lives look perfect.

## Adopt Affirmations

If you've ever worked with a coach or done any sort of self-care, you've probably heard of affirmations. 

## Get Clear on What You're Good At

As with anything, it's important to know yourself when it comes to your money. If you have financial impostor syndrome, you probably think you're not good at dealing with your money at all. But maybe that's not true! 

## Take Yourself Out of It

If it turns out to be true that your strengths do not lie in money management, there are still things you can do!
