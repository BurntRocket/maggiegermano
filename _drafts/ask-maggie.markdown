  #money questions without judgment! '

As a financial blogger, a lot of my writing and advice is fairly general. It's hard to give broad advice that can apply to individuals because there's no one-size-fits-all solution to personal finance. When I'm working with my clients one-on-one, I can give more specific advice, because I know them and I know their situation. However, I know that not everyone can afford (or wants to) work with me one-on-one, but I would still like to help people who have questions or conundrums. I get a lot of questions from family, friends, and clients that I think other people are probably wondering about as well. So I decided to start an advice column where I can answer individualized questions that others may have. And I wanted to make sure to continue my practice of non-judgment that I use in my coaching practice in this column. If you write in, I'll never make you feel bad about yourself for your financial situation, your past decisions, or your questions. 

I'll be accepting your questions via email, direct message, or in the comments below. There's no such things as a stupid question, so ask away!

*Dear Maggie,*

*I have recently received a small raise (approx. 4%). And a best practice I've been taught is that you never touch your raises, instead, you put it towards a savings (401K, personal savings account, investing, supporting my mother, etc).*

*My question is: how can I make the best decision of where this additional income should go? I have a few ideas (like the ones listed above) but I'm not sure where to begin so I'm stuck and haven't made any moves.*

*Is there a general formula I should follow? (i.e. a certain percentage of your disposable income should go towards savings, another towards 401K, investments?) Any advice will help - thank you!*

*THANK YOU!

Dear A Girl Looking for Financial Freedom,

Congratulations on your raise! 4% might not feel like much, but every bit helps in your journey to financial freedom. And you're absolutely on the right path since you want to put that raise towards your financial goals, rather than spending it right away. 

I don't personally believe that there's one financial formula that will apply to everyone, but the general advice is that you should be saving 20% of your income (including your retirement). 

My first question would be: how much are you contributing to your retirement savings now? You should at least be contributing up to the amount that your employer matches, if they offer a match. If you're already meeting that match amount, you should still consider increasing your contribution. It's important to increase your retirement contribution every time you get a raise. This ensures that you'll be saving more and more as you earn more, setting you up for success in retirement. 

Another question would be: do you have an emergency savings account already? If you haven't started building that yet, you may want to contribute part of your raise to that goal. The best way to start is to set up direct deposit into a savings account so that you're automatically saving towards this goal every time you get a paycheck. 

Once you're contributing as much as you can to retirement, you've built up an emergency savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses, and you've paid down any credit card debt, *then* you can start exploring other investment accounts. The typical stock market return is 7% over the course of the year. This is much better than regular savings accounts, but it's much lower than the interest rate that is charged on most credit cards. Which means if you're investing while you still have credit card debt, you're actually losing money. So prioritize that debt first.

Good luck and congratulations again!

Best,\
Maggie
