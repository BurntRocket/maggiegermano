Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* The company I'm speaking for next week paid the deposit for my speaking fee.

* One of my retainer clients paid their monthly fee.

* We have an Airbnb guest coming tonight.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I've had a head cold all week, so I bought some decongestant at Rite Aid.

* We went to a surprise birthday party for a friend on Wednesday and bought a drink and some dinner while we were out. 

* We've been getting regular pest service for our house and our monthly fee was due this week. 

* In Boston on Thursday, I bought myself lunch, tea, and snacks at the airport. 

## **What I’m Writing**

I revisited an old blog post about self care and expanded on what [self care looks like](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-practice-actual-self-care-on-a-budget/) on a budget.

## What I'm Saying

This week, on the [Money Circle podcast](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/my-biggest-money-mistake/), I answered a listener question about my biggest money mistake thus far.

## **What I’m Up To**

* Yesterday, I traveled to Boston to speak at Boston College for an event with [Funding Our Future](https://fundingourfuture.us/) and the [Center for Retirement Research](https://crr.bc.edu/). It was a fun opportunity to talk to students about student loans, saving for the future, and getting their money right.

* I just published the [October Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-preparing-for-holiday-spending-tickets-72080062407)! We’ll be gathering to discuss how to prepare for holiday spending weeks or even months in advance.

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I'm traveling to Atlanta for the first time next week for a speaking gig. I'm then going again about a week later for the She Podcasts conference! Send me any and all recommendations for things to do and eat in Atlanta.

## **What I’m Reading**

I'm currently reading *[A Woman Is No Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34313931-a-woman-is-no-man)* by Etaf Rum. I'm only 20 percent through the book, but so far, it's beautifully written and incredibly sad.

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
