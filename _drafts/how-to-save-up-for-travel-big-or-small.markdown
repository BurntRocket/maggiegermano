*Since August is a huge travel month, the blog theme is financially responsible travel! Tune in for plenty of tips on how to travel on a budget.*

Is travel a value of yours? Do you cherish experiences over things? I know how you feel! I love to travel and see new places, and I make it a priority in my life. However, I often hear from other people that they wish they could travel, but they just can't afford it. Of course, not everyone can afford to travel abroad on an annual basis, but that doesn't mean that you will never be able to see the cities you dream of.

That's how much you should automate to go into your travel savings account each month. 

## Save your windfalls

Did you get an end-of-year bonus at work? Are you expecting a hefty tax refund? If you don't have important bills to pay off with that money, set it aside for travel savings!
