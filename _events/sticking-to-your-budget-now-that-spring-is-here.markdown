Happy spring! It's finally sunny and warm, and the world feels like it's full of possibilities. You're ready to give up your Netflix binging and start going to rooftop happy hours and bottomless brunches. I hear you! But you don't have to also give up on the budget that you've worked so hard to create and stick to.

So join us for Money Circle in May, and learn how to stick to your budget while also enjoying spring and everything that comes with it.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.

**Payment:** You will be redirected Paypal to process your payment. Once completed, you will receive an email with details for the evening.

**Refunds:** Money Circle is a limited seating event. I also purchase wine and snacks based on the number of women joining us. Because of this, if you have to cancel for any reason within 24 hours, your ticket is non-refundable. However, feel free to gift it or sell it to a friend! Just be sure to let me know of the exchange at hello@maggiegermano.com.
