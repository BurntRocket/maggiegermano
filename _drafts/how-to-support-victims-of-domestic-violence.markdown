As I've mentioned over the past several weeks, October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. This month is not the only time that we should be fighting domestic violence, but it is a good time to really bring it to the forefront of people's minds. But just in case you want to continue doing your part in understanding domestic violence, reducing its prevalence, and helping survivors, this article is for you. It's all about what YOU can do to support victims of domestic violence. This can be in the form of money, or time, or energy. It's up to you to decide how you can contribute, but here are some ways to start.

## Show Your Friends That They Can Come to You

One of the reasons that people can feel trapped in an abusive relationship is that they have become isolated from their loved ones. They might feel like they have no one to turn to. If you have friends who might be in abusive relationships, even if you've become distanced from them, let them know if they can rely on you. You never know when they might need you.

## Volunteer at a Shelter

In just one day in 2015, over 31,500 adults and children fleeing domestic violence found refuge in a domestic violence emergency shelter or transitional housing program.

* That same day, domestic violence programs were unable to meet over 12,197 requests for services because of a lack of funding, staffing, or other resources.


* Sixty-three percent (7,728) of unmet requests were for housing. Emergency shelter and transitional housing continue to be the most urgent unmet needs for domestic violence survivors.
