Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had a guest in our Airbnb from Sunday evening until Friday morning, and another guest is arriving today through the weekend.

* Three of my clients paid their money fees this week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I joined my friend Nina for tea and yoga on Sunday evening. We went to [Takoma Beverage Company](http://takomabevco.com/) for tea and catching up, and then we went to a yoga beats class at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/). I'd never been to a yoga class like that, and it was really tough, but it was a lot of fun!

* Dan and I got our marriage license on Tuesday! We had to pay $55 for the license itself, and $8 for parking. After the wedding, we'll have to pay about $15 to get official copies of the license for our records (and to send to Dan's insurance company so I can get on his policy).

* Now that we're two weeks out from the wedding (gah!), we are doubling down on eating healthily so that we feel as good as possible on the day. We spent a bit extra on groceries this week in order to make sure we're eating well and aren't tempted to buy any junk.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about how I had the [money talk](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-i-had-the-money-talk-with-my-dude/) with my fiance when we were first dating.

## **What I’m Up To**

* I spoke to [European CEO](https://www.europeanceo.com/business-and-management/the-cost-of-sexual-assault/) about the physical, emotional, and financial toll of sexual assault and harassment.

* I was one of the guests on the live taping of the [Bossed Up](http://www.bossedup.org) podcast this week! We talked about women and wealth, and how to close the wage, investment, and wealth gaps. Stay tuned and I'll let you know when the episode goes up!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I'm getting married in two weeks! We hosted my dear friend (and real estate agent - hire her!) Liz Delgado-Steo for dinner last night, because she will be emceeing our wedding. Going over the details of the evening made it more real and exciting. 

* Getting married in two weeks means we're going on our honeymoon in 16 days! If you haven't yet told me your favorite things to do, see, or eat in Thailand, please comment below!
