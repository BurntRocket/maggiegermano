I remember while I was growing up, I only really heard about bankruptcy when it came to celebrities like MC Hammer or big businesses like General Motors. I also thought that bankruptcy was something that you could never come back from and was a big admission of defeat and failure. People talked about it like the people who file were stupid and should be ridiculed. But as I've gotten older, as with most things, I've realized that it's more complicated and nuanced than that. Sometimes bankruptcy is the best choice for some people.

## What Is Bankruptcy?

Bankruptcy is a legal process for an individual, family, or corporation that finds themselves unable to pay off their debts. In this scenario, the person or entity can have some or all of their debt erased.

There are two different kinds of bankruptcy for individuals: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 (Chapter 11 is only for businesses).

## What Is the Process for Filing?

The Chapter 7 bankruptcy process typically takes from four to six months to complete once it begins.

1. **Find a Good Attorney:** You should find an attorney to help you through this process. Make sure they are experienced in bankruptcies and familiar with bankruptcy law. Your state bar association should have directories with bankruptcy attorney information.  There are also online directories, such as the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys and the American Board of Certification, where you can find a qualified attorney.

2. **Conduct a Bankruptcy Counseling Session:** There are two mandatory [credit counseling sessions ](https://www.greenpath.com/counseling/bankruptcy-counseling/)that must be completed with a counseling agency that has been approved by the U.S. Justice Department. The first round of counseling happens before you file bankruptcy paperwork with the courts. During that session, the counselor will review your budget and look at the pros and cons of bankruptcy, as well as alternatives to bankruptcy.

3. **File for Bankruptcy With the Court:**

4. **Liquidation or Repayment:**

5. **Complete a Debtor Education Course:** This is a government-required education course. You must complete this before your debts will be wiped.

6. **Debt Discharge:**

## What Are the Limitations of Filing?

Not everyone can file for bankruptcy. There are limitations in place. You may not file if you obtained a discharge in a Chapter 7 case within the past eight years, or in a Chapter 13 case within the past six years. You may not file if a previous bankruptcy case (Chapter 7 or 13) was dismissed within the past 180 days because you violated a court order, you were determined to have engaged in fraudulent conduct, or you requested dismissal after a creditor requested relief from the automatic stay.

There are also several types of debt that will not be erased if you file bankruptcy:

* Most student loan debt

* Court-ordered alimony.

* Court-ordered child support

* Reaffirmed debt

* A federal tax lien for taxes owed to the U.S. government

* Government fines or penalties

* Court fines and penalties

## What Are the Benefits of Filing?

Of course, the obvious benefit of filing for bankruptcy is having some or all of your debts erased. This would allow you to start from scratch, financially speaking, and hopefully make better decisions moving forward.

## What Are Your Other Options?

For many, bankruptcy is not the right option. And it isn't always necessary to do. There are other avenues you can take to get control over your debt and manage your payments more successfully.
