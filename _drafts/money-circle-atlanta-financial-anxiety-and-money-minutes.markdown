Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* I spoke at a large corporation in Atlanta on Wednesday. In fact, it was my highest paid speaking gig ever. They paid a deposit a couple weeks ago when we signed the contract, and they paid the remainder of the fee this week. 

* One of my ongoing clients paid their monthly fee. 

* We have an Airbnb guest arriving tonight. 

* Dan's biweekly paycheck came in on Monday.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, [I wrote about](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/why-you-should-take-a-money-minute-every-week/) why I think everyone should take a money minute every week in order to stay on top of their finances.

## **What I’m Saying**

[On the podcast](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/managing-financial-anxiety/), I sat down with financial therapist [Lindsay Bryan-Podvin](https://www.mindmoneybalance.com/) to talk about financial anxiety. Make sure you're subscribed wherever you listen to podcasts so you never miss an episode!
