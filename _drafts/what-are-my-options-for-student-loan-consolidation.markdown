This month, I'll be writing full articles answering questions that have been asked by my clients and [Money Circle](http://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle) members. One question that comes up consistently is this: how can I consolidate my loans, and what are my options? Debt consolidation can be a great option if your monthly payments are high, or if you feel like you're not making a dent because your interest rates are so high. Options will differ based on your personal situation, so there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution.

## The Difference Between Consolidation and Refinancing

Debt consolidation and debt refinancing are two different things and they have different outcomes. And based on your financial situation, one may be better for you than the other.

* Debt consolidation is an official process through government channels.

* Refinancing means you're moving your student loans to a private loan company.

* If you refinance your student loans with a private company, you will be ineligible for [student loan forgiveness](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/the-complete-list-of-student-loan-forgiveness-programs/).

## Why You Might Want to Consolidate

* If you struggle to make your monthly payments.

* If you're in default and want to get back into repayment. 

## The Pros and Cons of Consolidating

There are pros and cons for any financial decision. The important thing is to weigh both sides of the coin and figure out what makes the most sense for you. What might be right for someone else, might not be right for you. So it's imperative that you look at your lifestyle and needs and make a decision based on them.

**Pros:**

* Consolidation may make your student loans more manageable by combining payments into one lower monthly bill.

* Consolidation is a way to get out of default and back into current repayment.

* You can switch any variable-rate loans you have to a fixed interest rate.

**Cons:**

* Consolidating can prolong your loan repayment period, and thus increase the amount you're paying in interest.

* If you’re paying your current loans under an income-driven repayment plan, or if you’ve made qualifying payments toward [Public Service Loan Forgiveness](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service), consolidating your current loans will cause you to lose credit for any payments made toward income-driven repayment plan forgiveness or Public Service Loan Forgiveness.x

* You can't consolidate private loans through the federal [Direct Consolidation Program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/consolidation). 

## How You Can Consolidate

Visit [StudentLoans.gov](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/launchConsolidation.action). There, you can apply for a consolidation loan and sign a promissory note. You will need all of your student loan account information for this. At this time, you will also choose which type of repayment plan you will want once the consolidation is complete. Make sure you look into the [different repayment options](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/student-loan-repayment-plans/) first. 

## If You Decide to Refinance Instead

Perhaps after reading this article, you decide that loan consolidation won't actually help you, and you want to refinance instead. That's great! That means you have received information that shows you what is right for you. But how should you go about doing that?

* Do your research! There are so many consolidation companies out there. You want to make sure you're choosing one that is reputable and that actually helps you get to a better financial place. 

* Compare your options. Refinancing companies will let you get a quote for what your rates will be based on your credit score and credit history. 

* Read the fine print. Make sure you're aware of any hidden fees or variable interest rates. One important potential fee is a early payoff penalties. This means that you get charged extra fees if you pay off your loan sooner than the original terms. If you're lucky enough to pay off your loan faster than planned, make sure you won't be punished for it. Another important fee is an origination fee. Most loans (and credit card balance transfers) include origination fees, but some places don't have them. Sometimes, it can be a substantive amount of additional money, so do your calculations and see what makes sense for you. 

Regardless of what you decide, make sure you do your research. It can be scary to make big financial decisions, but it gets a little bit easier if you're moving forward as informed as possible. And make sure you're doing what's best for *you*, not just doing what you think you should do, or what other people are doing.
