January is often used as the month to [reflect](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/reflecting-on-2017/) on the previous year and [set goals](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/easy-financial-goals-for-2018/) and intentions for the coming one.

## You Avoid Your Money

## You Feel Ashamed of Your Finances

## You Spend Money to Deal with Your Emotions

This is so, so common. Many (most?) of us turn to spending in order to fill a void or cope with a negative (or positive!) emotion. We even spend money to celebrate a positive emotion.

## You Don't Know What Your Goals Are

## You Don't Want to Talk to Loved Ones About Money
