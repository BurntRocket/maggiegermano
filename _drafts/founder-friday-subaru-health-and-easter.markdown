Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Well, Dan and I bought a car! 

* We hired someone to do our taxes this year, and we owed Maryland a large sum of money. I paid the bill through Maryland's online tax portal. Luckily, we'd saved enough to cover the amount. Plus, we got a Federal refund, so we actually saved too much money for taxes!

* Dan put a bunch of work travel spending on our joint credit card. Luckily, we'll get reimbursed by the end of the month. Plus, we're able to collect the points!
