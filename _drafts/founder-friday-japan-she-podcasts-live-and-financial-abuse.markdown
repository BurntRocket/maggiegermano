## **What I’m Up To**

* I was Googling myself the other day to find the podcasts that I've been interviewed on and I found a piece I submitted to Reese Witherspoon's site, [Hello Sunshine](https://hello-sunshine.com/)! I submitted this piece last year and never heard back, so I figured they weren't interested. Turns out, [they published it](https://hello-sunshine.com/post/why-money-is-a-feminist-issue-and-what-im-doing-about-it)!

* I’ve created a virtual [Money Circle membership program](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)! If you are not located in the DC area, or if you just want more connection through Money Circle, this program is for you. There are 3 tiers that offer different options at different price points. There is a group coaching component and even a level that lets you check in with me every month. [Sign up today!](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)
