Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* Dan's bi-weekly paycheck was deposited on Tuesday.

* We have had two different Airbnb guests.

* One of my retainer clients paid their monthly fee.

* Two of my ongoing coaching clients paid their monthly fees.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Sunday, I was traveling from Atlanta back to Maryland, so I spent some money on snacks and food throughout the day. I also paid to visit the [Atlanta Botanical Garden](https://atlantabg.org/) in the afternoon before my flight. If you haven't been there, I recommend it! It was really cool.

* On Monday, I noticed that we were running low on a few things for the Airbnb, so I bought more candy, body wash, and air freshener.

* We're leaving for Peru in 3 weeks from today! (!!!) Most of our trip has been booked and paid for already, but I finally booked our roundtrip flight from Lima to Cusco yesterday.

* We're hosting a Halloween party at our house this year, and requiring that people dress up, so we are working on our own costumes. We ordered a couple things to finalize those costumes.

* Today, I met up with my friend Liz to catch up over coffee and tea. I bought myself some tea and a snack.

## **What I’m Writing**

* This week, [on my blog](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-financial-abuse-looks-like/), I wrote about the ways that financial abuse can show up in abusive relationships.

* On my [ForbesWomen column](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2019/10/17/domestic-violence-has-a-financial-impact-too/), I wrote about the economic impact of financial abuse.

## **What I’m Saying**

* This week, on the [Money Circle podcast](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/how-to-manage-money-as-a-family/), I chatted with Chelsea Brennan of [Smart Money Mamas](https://smartmoneymamas.com/) about how to manage money as a family. It was a fun conversation that I think anyone would benefit from. Bonus: make sure that you sign up for Chelsea's [Mamas Talk Money Summit](https://mamastalkmoney.com/) that is opening next week!

* I was at She Podcasts Live in Atlanta last weekend and had a great time and met a lot of amazing women. One of those women was [Meg Wheeler](https://megkwheeler.com/) of the [One for Womankind podcast](https://oneforwomen.com/podcast/). I got in a recording booth with her and Brianna Wilkerson of [Made Well](http://www.madewell345.com/) to talk about our takeaways of the conference and [that episode](https://oneforwomen.com/2019/10/16/she-podcasts-live/) went live today.

## **What I’m Up To**

* I was Googling myself the other day to find the podcasts that I've been interviewed on and I found a piece I submitted to Reese Witherspoon's site, [Hello Sunshine](https://hello-sunshine.com/)! I submitted this piece last year and never heard back, so I figured they weren't interested. Turns out, [they published it](https://hello-sunshine.com/post/why-money-is-a-feminist-issue-and-what-im-doing-about-it)!

* I'm doing some thinking about what topics I want to cover in upcoming Money Circle meetups in Washington, DC. Send your preferences in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9h1xvbIg9UctjkOCfY7hWgAz5O1lOn07xX6ztEyiE3r96Uw/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

* I’ve created a virtual [Money Circle membership program](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)! If you are not located in the DC area, or if you just want more connection through Money Circle, this program is for you. There are 3 tiers that offer different options at different price points. There is a group coaching component and even a level that lets you check in with me every month. [Sign up today!](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)

## **What I’m Excited About**

* Last week, Dan and I booked our flights to go to Japan in January! There is a graphic design conference happening in Tokyo in late January, so we're taking advantage and adding a vacation to it. Dan has wanted to go to Japan for basically his whole life and we're both very excited to finally see it. If you've been there and have recommendations, send them my way!

* As I mentioned above, we're going to Peru in 3 weeks! I've been dying to see Peru for a decade, and I'm so excited that it's finally happening. If you have recommendations, send them my way!

## **What I’m Reading**

I'm like five pages away from finishing *[Stay Sexy & Don't Get Murdered](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41068144-stay-sexy-don-t-get-murdered)* by Georgia Hardstark and Karen Kilgariff. It has actually been a lovely read, mostly filled with their own experiences and how they've been shaped into who they are today. Once I'm done with that, I'm going to go back to *[My Sister, the Serial Killer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38819868-my-sister-the-serial-killer?ac=1&from_search=true)* by Oyinkan Braithwaite.

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
