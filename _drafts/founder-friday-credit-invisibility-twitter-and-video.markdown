## **What I’m Up To**

* Twitter chat

* The [April Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-honoring-self-care-keeping-your-pockets-full-tickets-59004572264) meet up is ready for registration! We’ll be joined by Megan Sanchez of Upswing Health Coaching to talk about prioritizing self-care while on a budget.

* I want to hear from you! As I am continuing to create blog content and expanding my work into online courses, a podcast, and more workshops, I want to make sure I’m creating things that are useful to YOU. I’ve made a survey for my clients and readers to hear about what you most want to learn about.

## **What I’m Excited About**

* A couple weeks ago, [Izabelle Azevedo](https://www.itsmissizabelle.com/) contacted me on Instagram asking if I wanted to be part of her new venture, [Red Skirt Media](https://www.redskirtmedia.com/). It's a media company that aims to help women's entrepreneurs use video in order to stand out in the crowd. Izabelle and I met up on Wednesday for our first video session in downtown DC. Next week, she'll be coming to my house to do more video. I can't wait to see how it all turns out! If you're interested in using video to expand your brand, contact her!

* Dan and I hired Meg Madden to do our taxes for us this year. It's the first year we're filing jointly, it's the first year where I have only self-employment income, and it's the first year that we have our Airbnb income. Plus, Dan had some freelance income in 2018. Needless to say, we felt a little out of our depth in doing our taxes ourselves, so we hired Meg. She got us all the deductions possible and instead of owing thousands of dollars, we're actually going to end up getting some money back! I'm feeling pretty amazing about that!
