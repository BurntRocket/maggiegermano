Every year, November ushers in open enrollment season for most Americans. This means that people who get benefits through their employer, or through the [healthcare marketplace](https://www.healthcare.gov/ "https://www.Healthcare.gov"), take this time to review and re-enroll in their benefits for 2021. This is most often discussed in terms of health insurance, but it covers other benefits, as well.

If you miss the open enrollment period, you will miss your opportunity to have the available benefits for 2021, unless you have a significant life change (like a job loss) that will allow you to qualify for the healthcare marketplace. And in the United States, an unexpected medical expense is the leading cause of bankruptcy, so this is not something you want to delay or ignore.

Recently, I chatted with Meredith Ryan-Reid, the senior vice president and head of [MetLife’s](https://www.metlife.com/ "https://www.metlife.com/") Financial Wellness & Engagement organization, and Marsha Barnes, a personal finance expert, financial social worker, commentator and Founder of [The Finance Bar](https://www.thefinancebar.com/ "https://www.thefinancebar.com/"). We discussed [MetLife’s recent open enrollment study](https://www.metlife.com/about-us/newsroom/2020/september/workers-say-getting-benefits-right-is-even-more-important-this-year/ "https://www.metlife.com/about-us/newsroom/2020/september/workers-say-getting-benefits-right-is-even-more-important-this-year/") and how employees can be sure to make the right benefits decisions for themselves this year.

**People Are More Concerned About Their Financial Health**

Although the majority of employees cite a pandemic-related reason for the increased importance placed on this year’s employee benefits enrollment, other leading concerns are personal finance issues, including worries over financial security or losing income due to COVID-19, and rising healthcare costs. As the unemployment rate rises, with no sign of another COVID relief stimulus, these concerns are completely valid. Plus, the Supreme Court, this week, started hearing a case challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, which could throw our healthcare system as it currently exists into complete disarray.

**Nearly Half of Employees Say Open Enrollment Is More Important This Year**

According to the MetLife survey, 48 percent of respondents said that open enrollment is more important this year than it was last year. And two-thirds of those people said that the main driver of that was because of COVID-19. “People have a lot of concern about their physical health, their family, and who they need to care for and protect. And then I also think that people are just worried about their personal finances. So it’s it’s a double whammy,” said Ryan-Reid. Enrolling in the right benefits can not only protect your health during uncertain times, but it can also protect your finances from unexpected health expenses.

**75 Percent of Employees Are More Interested In Their Benefits This Year**

Not only do employees think that open enrollment is more important this year, but they are also more interested in the broad spectrum of benefits this year. In fact, 75 percent of respondents said that they have particular benefits they are more interested in this year than last. “We’re seeing a lot more interest in specific benefits, like life insurance. Some of the pre-tax health and flexible savings accounts are very interesting to people, as are the supplemental health products that can help protect out of pocket expenses,” said Ryan-Reid.

Some of the other benefits respondents are particularly interested in are:
