Happy Friday! I hope you survived the week without too much stress. I'm just glad the sun came out for a day. So here's my weekly round-up!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* Two clients' monthly payments went through this week.

* We got our first [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21754745) guest! We've had so many people sign up that we're wondering if we're charging too low for the space.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I are trying out the [Flat Belly Diet](https://www.amazon.com/Flat-Belly-Diet-Liz-Vaccariello/dp/1250013356) this week, so we spend a hefty sum on groceries on Sunday. It was about $150, but we won't be going out to eat at all, so it'll be worth it.

* To pre-empt our attempts at flat bellies, we had an early Valentine's Day date at [Le Diplomate](http://lediplomatedc.com/). **Bonus:** we used a gift card that my parents sent Dan as a congratulations on his promotion. French pastries taste so much better when they're free.

## What I'm Writing

Wednesday was Valentine's Day, and just in time, a study came out about money and relationships. Read [my piece](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/stop-fighting-about-money-with-your-valentine/) about how to stop fighting with your beau about money.

## What I'm Excited About

* I finally painted our kitchen cabinets! 

* The February Money Circle gathering is next week! Join us on Wednesday, February 21st to discuss how to better communicate with our loved ones about money. It can be a really tricky subject, but we can help you do it better!

## What I'm Fan-Girling Over

* How did I just get into *[Nashville](http://abc.go.com/shows/nashville)* this past weekend?? I knew Connie Britton was missing from my life. I finally started the show from the beginning and I'm obsessed. It has just enough drama, hot men, and country music.
