Dan and I are getting married this Saturday (!!!???). It's been a pretty long engagement, and if we could do it over again, I'd rather get married sooner and spend much less time planning a wedding. But here we are, finally. 

A couple of months ago, we teamed up with a therapist for pre-marital counseling. It was important to me for us to prepare for marriage by going through this counseling. We had attended an 8-hour pre-marital workshop in January and enjoyed it, but I knew we'd benefit from more support. 

We couldn't find a pre-marital therapist that accepted insurance. Even though we would have to pay out of pocket, it was important to me, so I was willing to make the investment. I allocated a portion of my monthly income one month to make it happen.
