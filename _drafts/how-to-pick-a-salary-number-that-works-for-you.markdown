A very common salary question I get is: how much money should I ask for?

It's hard for me to answer that question, because it really depends on the individual. Just like there's no [one-size-fits-all budget](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-create-a-budget-that-works-for-you/), there's no go-to salary number. Of course, there's an appropriate range in each sector, but the right number depends on you. So let's dive in.

## How much do you need?

Look at your numbers. How much money do you need to earn to cover your minimum required expenses? This includes retirement savings, debt payments, groceries, transportation, etc. This number is important, because you always want to make sure that you're earning more than you're spending. If you aren't sure about your number, set up an account with Mint, Learnvest, or ClarityMoney. You can review that past few months worth of spending to see what you typically spend in a month. This will also give you clarity on areas that you might want to cut back in. Bonus: ClarityMoney will point out all your recurring expenses and flag if there is anything you might want to cancel.

## How much do you want?

Now that you've looked at the actual numbers, you should think about what you *really* want. What are your [goals](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/3-easy-financial-goals-for-2017/)? Think big. What number would help you achieve your goals? What number would make you feel fairly compensated? This number is also very important! You should feel great about the salary you are asking for. If you're confident in what you're asking for, you'll be more confident during the negotiation process.

## What does the sector pay?

Do your homework! Find out how much the typical salary is for the work you want to do. You can do this by asking people you know who work in the field or at the organization you're interested in. (That's also a good way to get some informational interviews.) You can also use resources like [Salary.com](www.salary.com) or [Glassdoor.com](glassdoor.com).

Don't forget to negotiate your full compensation package! Check out last week's blog to learn other benefits you can negotiate.

## Do these numbers line up?

Look at how much you need, how much you want, and how much the sector pays. Do the numbers match up? Are they even close?
