Happy Friday! I hope you survived the week without too much stress. I'm just glad the sun came out for a day. So here's my weekly round-up!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* A new, one-time client paid for and scheduled her one-time session.

* The money hasn't come in yet, but we listed our [basement Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21754745?=&s=41&ref_device_id=df23617cff9a0aee816d728fcdeaf31b88da1585&user_id=8094455&_branch_match_id=489896607236963490) and already have 5 bookings for the next couple of months! I was worried we wouldn't get a lot of guests, but it seems successful already. 

## How I Spent Money This Week

* On Sunday, I met up with my friend Nina for tea and some shopping. I had a coupon for a free drink at [Bakers and Baristas](https://www.bakersandbaristas.com/), so I only spent $3.50 on my chocolate croissant. Then we went to [LOFT](https://www.loft.com/), where I spent $60 on a blouse and a cardigan. Each item was originally $50, so I got a great discount. I've been slowly trying to create a wardrobe that I'm happy and confident in, so I'm glad that I was able to find two pieces that I like! Plus, I can pull this expense from my fun fund.

* I bought a (teal) arm chair, curtains, and a new light fixture for my home office! I've been waiting to do this for about two months, and I have the business savings to cover the costs. **Bonus:** the expense will be tax-deductible since it's for the office I use exclusively for my business. Pictures to come!

* I've been putting off buying new skincare products for a while now. But it's finally getting to the point where I can't neglect my face and hope it still looks good. So I splurged on several [Glossier](http://bff.glossier.com/hWsVP) items, which cost about $100 total. This kind of spending isn't really in my budget at the moment, but that's what I have my [fun fund](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/budgeting-for-the-fun-stuff/) for!

* We spent a little over $100 on groceries this week. We were out of a lot of staples and stocked back up. Dan also made a big chicken pot pie dish that lasted for a few days. We also have our weekly [Hungry Harvest](http://hharvest.net/m5didTk) delivery coming on Friday, which costs about $24 for a dozen eggs and a whole bunch of veggies.

* Last weekend, Dan and I did another wine tasting at our wedding venue. We picked out the white wines that we'll be serving to our guests. It sure costs more than three-buck Chuck at Trader Joe's! So we had to pay the invoice for that order, but luckily we already had wedding savings set aside to cover it. 

* I spent more money than I planned this week! I went out to happy hour on Wednesday with some friends. I'm trying to prioritize friendship, especially now that I'm working from home and living out in the 'burbs. So the $15 on beer and bratwurst was worth it. 

## What I'm Writing

It's tax season, so [I wrote about](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-do-your-taxes/) how to get started on doing your taxes. It doesn't have to be the most stressful time of year!

## What I'm Excited About

* Dan and I booked our [wedding photographer](http://www.barbaraophotography.com/) and I officially bought my wedding dress (with tax, it was $254.40)! When things start getting done and I can cross them off my list, this all feels a lot more exciting and real.

* I was asked to do two speaking gigs! More details to come, but they're exciting opportunities.

## What I'm Fan-Girling Over

* Loving the [Stuff Mom Never Told You](https://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/podcasts/can-marriage-be-feminist.htm) episode about whether marriage can be feminist. Bonus: Jill Filipovic is the guest! Can't wait to read her book, *[The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/H-Spot-Feminist-Pursuit-Happiness/dp/1568585470)*.

* I also enjoy pretty websites that also help us take care of ourselves. Check out [Touch-Yourself.com](http://touch-yourself.com/) to learn how to properly give yourself a breast exam.

* [A Practical Wedding](https://apracticalwedding.com/)! I'm sure I'll be referencing them a lot when I write my posts about wedding planning, but I want to give them a shout out today. If you want reasonable, supportive wedding advice, they should be your go-to! And if you haven't read their book yet, [check it out](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Wedding-Affordable-Meaningful-Celebration/dp/0738215155)!

## Money Tips to Take Into the Weekend

* If you're in the DC area, it's going to be raining all weekend. So grab some affordable snacks and snuggle in for the weekend. Don't want to be alone? Invite a friend over to watch your favorite old movies and eat homemade popcorn.
