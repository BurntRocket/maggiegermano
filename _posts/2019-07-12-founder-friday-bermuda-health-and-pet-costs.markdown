Happy Friday, everyone! I'm back to business after traveling for over a week. Here’s what I was up to.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* I had a paid speaking engagement at [Axios](https://www.axios.com/) this Wednesday.

* Dan and I had several Airbnb guests.

* Two of my clients' monthly payments went through.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Sunday, Dan and I returned from our week-long cruise to Bermuda on Norwegian Cruise Line. My grandmother paid for the majority of the trip, which was amazing, but we were charged service fees everyday, so we had a $200 bill by the time we got back.

* On Sunday night, we were too tired to go shopping and make dinner, so we ordered Chinese food from our favorite place, [King Kong Restaurant](https://www.kingkongadelphi.com/). We still have some cash left over from wedding gifts, which we've been using to treat ourselves to takeout once in a while.

* On Monday evening, Dan and I did our weekly grocery run at Whole Foods. We had to stock up on a few things after being gone for a week, so we spent a little over $100.

* I've been working with a functional medicine doctor recently to figure out some health issues that I want to get in order. I had to pay an up front charge for one of the tests on Monday, but hopefully my insurance covers most of it.

* When I spoke at Axios on Wednesday, I paid $50 for parking in a parking garage. I also killed some time by going into the nearby Trader Joe's and bought some parmesan cheese and chocolate.

* On Thursday, I returned two shirts to Target and bought some shampoo and conditioner.

* Bruno got neutered this morning! The procedure cost just over $300. We also had Bruno in daycare one day this week, which cost $36. (That puppy is expensive!)

* After we dropped Bruno off at the vet this morning, Dan and I went to [Vigilante Coffee](https://www.vigilantecoffee.com/) to have a light breakfast and coffee and tea.

## **What I’m Writing**

* This week, [on my blog](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/despite-having-less-support-women-outpace-men-in-financial-independence/), I republished a past [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2019/06/17/despite-having-less-support-women-outpace-men-in-financial-independence/#2a34e1ec9462) piece. The piece is about

* Last week, I had a guest post on the [Daily Outfit](https://dailyoutfit.com/how-to-keep-impulse-spending-at-bay/) blog. I wrote about how to resist impulse spending.

## **What I’m Up To**

## **What I’m Reading**

While I was on vacation last week, I read the entirety of *[The Bride Test](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39338454-the-bride-test)* by Helen Hoang. This week, I finished reading *[Thick: And Other Essays](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40365093-thick?ac=1&from_search=true)* by Tressie McMillan Cottom. I'm still working my way through *[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power?from_search=true)* by Naomi Alderman, but I plan to finish it this weekend.
