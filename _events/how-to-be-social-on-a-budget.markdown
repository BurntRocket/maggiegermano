It's time for round two! This month, we will focus on navigating our social life while trying to save money. Living in DC, there are always invites for happy hour, dinner, brunch, and more. Sometimes it’s hard (or embarrassing) to talk to our loved ones about spending less and sticking to a budget. I know I approached this the wrong way when I first started learning how to budget, so I’m sure many of you have struggled with this as well. Let’s explore solutions together!

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they have around money.

There will be snacks, wine, and tea for all. This event is very casual, and all you have to bring is yourself and openness.
