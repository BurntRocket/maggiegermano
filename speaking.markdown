speaker-topics: "## Speaker Topics\n\nMaggie is happy to speak about many different
  topics related to money, but these are some of her specific talks:\n\n### How Working
  Women Can Manage Money At Any Age\nThere’s no magical age when you can stop thinking
  about money and setting financial goals. At every stage of your life and career,
  there are important financial steps to take and challenges to overcome. This talk
  will break down the most important financial considerations and decisions decade
  by decade and cover topics like saving for retirement, negotiating a raise, creating
  and sticking to a budget, paying off high-interest debt, and more. \n\n### Building
  Your Financial Confidence\nxx\n\n### Getting Your Money Right\nWant to improve your
  finances but not sure where to start? You’re absolutely not alone. In this workshop,
  you’ll learn what you need to do from start to finish to take control of your money,
  so you can get out of debt, start saving, grow your emergency fund, and plan for
  your future. This topic is designed for those who are just starting out on their
  financial journey, so it is easy to comprehend, with tangible, actionable next steps
  to take away.\n\n### Getting Financially Naked With Your Partner\nYou know that
  communication is one of the most important things in a romantic relationship. If
  you don't have good communication, it's hard to have a secure foundation in the
  relationship. You also might know that money conflict is one of the top causes of
  relationship strife. Plus, money makes or breaks our ability to reach our goals
  and it determines what we're able to do in life. That's why it's so important to
  talk to your life partner about money. This talk will help you learn how to have
  constructive money conversations with your partner, set goals together, and create
  a plan to reach those goals together."

workshops: "## Workshops\n\nMaggie is able to tailor her workshops to your specific
  needs, but her existing workshops are:\n\n### Jumpstarting Your Financial Wellness\nFinancial
  literacy is not required learning in school, so you likely grew up without a clear
  sense of right and wrong when it comes to your money. Knowing this, it can be difficult
  to manage your money in a way that sets you up for success. This workshop will help
  you get clarity on your budget, create a plan to pay down debt and build up savings,
  and feel confident that you’re making the right financial decisions moving forward.
  \n\n### Aligning Your Values With Your Money\nBudgeting isn’t just about the numbers.
  It’s also about feeling energized by and emotionally connected to your financial
  goals. That’s why it’s so important to align your values with those goals. This
  workshop will show you how to identify your values and create financial goals that
  align with them so you can stay motivated and consistent along the way.\n\n### Asking
  For More At Work\nThe gender and racial wage gaps are alive and well. And while
  our government and businesses need to do the bulk of the work to fix this, the rest
  of us don’t have to sit idly by while we wait. This workshop will show you how to
  identify your value and contributions at work, research the market value of your
  position, and have the income conversation, whether you’re interviewing for a new
  job or negotiating your current salary with your boss.\n\n### Making and Breaking
  the Budget\nThe traditional approach to budgeting - where you set strict spending
  limitations and cut out all things that bring joy - is broken. And it definitely
  doesn't work for young professionals and millennials who want their money to allow
  them freedom, security, and happiness. We need a new way to approach budgeting,
  and that means creating a budget that works for you and your life, goals, and values.
  This workshop will help you identify your values, determine your goals, and create
  a budget that you’ll actually want to stick to."
