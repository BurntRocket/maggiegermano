If you're like many people, the end of the calendar year also means it's performance review time. Even if you've already been through your review for the year, it's always a good time to brush up on how to ask for a raise. 

Join us at Money Circle this month and you'll walk away with concrete ways to ask for a raise and back up the ask with evidence that you deserve it.
