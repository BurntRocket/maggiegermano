Happy Friday, y'all! I don't know about you, but I'm ready for a long weekend of fun and relaxation. Here's what I was up to this week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We've had a visiting professor from Austria staying in our Airbnb since Monday.

* A monthly client's payment went through this week.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* I spent $100 on a wedding makeup trial on Monday. It was my third trial (ugh), but it will hopefully also be my last! I loved the makeup artist and we've reached out to tell her that I want to book her for my wedding day. (PS: What do you think about me doing a dark red lip for my wedding day? It's an evening autumn wedding, so it seems perfect.)

* Dan and I are doing well in our second week of meal planning. We mapped out our dinners and lunches for the week and bought a bunch of groceries at Safeway. So far, I have been less tempted to buy more food, because there is always a plan in place and plenty of leftovers.

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about [how I'm incorporating my personal values](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-im-incorporating-values-into-my-wedding/) into my wedding day.

## What I’m Excited About

* Dan and I are going to Frederick, Maryland this weekend! We're only going for Sunday night, because we waited too long to book a place, and that was the only night that was available. We found a place that has all you can eat seafood, including crabs, clams, and shrimp. I plan to eat myself sick. (Got other recommendations in Frederick? Leave them in the comments! We're especially interested in local breweries.)

* I hosted [Solopreneur Circle](https://www.solopreneurcircle.com/) at my house on Wednesday! I'm so grateful to have found this group of women, so that I have people to turn to and spend time with now that I'm an entrepreneur.

* I met up with [Emilie Aries](https://emiliearies.com/) from [Bossed Up](https://bossedup.org/) and several other bosses last weekend to talk about how [Bossed Up Bootcamp](https://bossedup.org/bootcamp/) has changed our career trajectory. It was wonderful to be around so many inspiring women, and I can't wait to see what comes out of it!

## What I’m Up To

* I was interviewed on the [Elevate You podcast](https://player.fm/series/elevate-you/ep-04-aligning-your-money-spending-habits-with-what-you-truly-value-with-maggie-germano) this week! We talked about how women can take control of their finances in order to live their most elevated and abundant life. Take a listen!

* The [June Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-make-a-budget/) event is up! We'll be gathering to create our own budgets! I'll be there to guide you and answer your questions. See you there?

* I’m speaking at AAUW’s [National Conference for College Women Student Leaders](https://www.nccwsl.org/) (NCCWSL)! I will be on a panel called, [“Secure Finances for a Secure Future”](https://www.nccwsl.org/about/workshops/), held on Friday, June 1st from 12:30-2pm.

* I’m teaming up with [General Assembly on Tuesday, June 26th](https://generalassemb.ly/education/mo-money-mo-worries-get-financially-savvy-in-2018/washington-dc/49127) for a free personal finance workshop. See you there?
