I’m back! I was traveling for the last several Fridays, so I took a break from my Founder Friday posts. But I’m back until the end of June! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## What I’m Up To

* The [May Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-improve-your-credit-score-tickets-60438017738) is coming up on Tuesday, May 21st! This month, we’ll be talking about how you can improve your credit score. [See you there](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-improve-your-credit-score-tickets-60438017738)?

* On the day after Money Circle, May 22nd, I’ll be sponsoring the DC event for the [Bossed Up book tour](https://www.facebook.com/events/407079006790252/)! I’ve known Emilie for years and she’s a huge reason for why I decided to start my own business. I’m excited to read her book and I’m proud to sponsor this event!

## What I’m Reading

I'm still reading *[A Princess in Theory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35271238-a-princess-in-theory)*, but I've also started *[99 Percent Mine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36300625-99-percent-mine)* by Sally Thorne. It's cute and I'm enjoying it more than *A Princess in Theory*.
