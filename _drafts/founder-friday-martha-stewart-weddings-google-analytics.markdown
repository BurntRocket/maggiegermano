Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week, even though it was pretty wet. Here’s what I was up to!

## **What I’m Up To**

* I was quoted in [Martha Stewart Weddings](https://www.marthastewartweddings.com/641372/should-you-go-into-debt-for-wedding) this week! I talked about how important it is to not go into debt for your wedding. Check it out!

* I’m speaking at [Robert Morris University](https://www.rmu.edu/) next weekend! There was a last minute cancelation at one of their orientation events, so I’m filling in to talk about money. I’m hoping to do more events like this, because it’s important to get your money right from a young age, and I want to reach women in college! So if you know of any universities who are looking for money experts, [let me know](mailto:boss@maggiegermano.com).

* I’m holding my first official workshop! On Saturday, September 15th, we’ll be gathering at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/) in Petworth, DC to learn how to budget! Sign up for the [Making & Breaking the Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) workshop today!

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/) is planned and ready for registration! We’ll be focusing on homebuying for first-timers, and we’ll be joined by the wonderful real estate agent (and dear friend) [Liz Delgado-Steo](https://www.realliving.com/elizabeth-delgado-steo). Liz is great at breaking down the homebuying process into language you can understand, so this is a meetup you can’t miss! [Register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-homebuying-for-newbies-tickets-48132651055)!
