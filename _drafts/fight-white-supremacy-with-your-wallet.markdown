I want to use this platform and my privilege as a white woman to explicitly condemn the racist white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, VA this past weekend. I'm sick over the message and the resulting violence and death. It is clear that this hatred is not new, and did not come out of nowhere.

## Donate to anti-racism/hate organizations

There are so many organizations that are fighting racism and violence in the United States. There are also organizations that are providing much needed services to our underserved populations. So, if you can, donate to the organizations below and help them continue their invaluable work.

[NAACP](http://www.naacp.org/)\
[Black Lives Matter](http://blacklivesmatter.com/)\
[Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/)\

## Donate to progressive candidates

Yes, the 2016 presidential election was important, but the 2018 mid-term elections and all local elections matter just as much, if not more. Our representatives in Congress make our laws, good or bad. 

Of course, there are many things we can do that do not involve opening our wallets. If you want to take things a step further, or if you can't afford to donate your money, there are other things you can do.

## Volunteer

## Speak up

I believe that silence makes you complicit. If you don't speak up when you hear or see racist, homophobic, sexist, or transphobic words or behavior, you're condoning it. Your silence tells your friends and family that what they do and say is okay, and that they will not have to face consequences. 

## Call your representatives

Vote!

There is truly no excuse for not voting, if you are an eligible voter. I know our political system can be demoralizing, and it often feels like our vote doesn't matter. But the only time our vote doesn't matter is when we don't cast it.
