It's one of the scariest positions to be in. It's the thing that you hope will never happen. But unemployment is real and many of us find ourself in the midst of it at some point in our lives. Regardless of how long you're unemployed, it can wreak havoc on your peace of mind and your finances. There are, however, some steps you can take to try to limit that negative impact. Many of these steps will protect your credit in the long run.

## File for Unemployment

I wrote last week about when and how to file for unemployment benefits. This is a great safety net offered by our federal and state governments. If you're eligible, make sure you file so that you can have some money coming in while you search for a new job.

## Alert Your Student Loan Provider

If you're having financial hardship, you can defer your student loans.

## Apply for Marketplace Insurance

If you've lost your job, you've most likely lost your health insurance as well. Since losing your job is considered a life event, you will be eligible to get insurance through the marketplace. 

## Search for New Jobs

If you file for unemployment, you will be required to apply for at least three jobs each week, and show proof that you've done it. Not only does this ensure that you're getting your benefit check, but it's a good accountability measure to make sure you are staying on top of your job search. 

If you don't know where to start, reach out to the people in your networks! 

## Turn to Your Emergency Savings

Hopefully you've been able to build up some sort of emergency savings for times like this. And if you haven't yet and are still employed, start prioritizing it now! It can be scary and frustrating to have to use your emergency savings, but that's literally what you saved it for. Losing your job is definitely an emergency, and you need that money in order to keep a roof over your head, food in your belly, and your bills current. So I am giving you permission to use your emergency savings on your bills in this scenario. 

## Don't Borrow from Your Retirement

This is so, so, so important. And I will yell this from the rooftops for the rest of my life. Never borrow from your retirement! You will be much worse off later if you do this. 

## Don't Only Rely on COBRA

After you lose or leave a job, you typically get a letter in the mail about COBRA insurance. 

## Don't Rely on Your Credit Cards

Of course, this can be impossible when you have bills to pay and mouths to feed, with not much money coming in.
