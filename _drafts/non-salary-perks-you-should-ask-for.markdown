*This is part oneÂ for July's theme of getting the most out of your career!*

When I look around and read about career negotiation, I typically only see advice about negotiating your salary. This is very important; I'll be writing about it soon myself! But there are other things that are negotiable when you're choosing an employer, and you should make sure to ask for them. 

As the world starts to change, employees want to have a better work-life blend. We don't want to be chained to our desks all day, everyday. We want our lives to be flexible and fulfilling, and employers are beginning to change their policies to accommodate that. However, if you are offered a job by an employer that does not yet have these policies, you may have to ask for them yourself. That's really the only way things change anyway; we have to demand it.

## Paid Time Off

I have been fortunate to work for a company that has very generous time off, but I've seen other people struggle with the opposite experience. It actually never occurred to me that time off could be negotiable until I saw a friend do it. When my friend (and former co-worker) decided to change jobs, she was okay with taking a slight pay cut. However, she wasn't thrilled with the idea of losing 1-2 weeks of vacation each year. When she was offered her new job, she told them she wanted one more week off than they offered. They agreed! If an employer really wants you, they'll often give you what you want (within reason). But once you get those extra vacation days, don't forget to actually use them! Half of Americans leave their vacation days unused, because they worry [they'll lose their jobs](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/55-of-american-workers-dont-take-all-their-paid-vacation-2016-06-15) if they take time off. Make it very clear to your new employer that you will be using the days allotted to you. If they balk at you, they may not be the right fit.

If you have trouble negotiating these things at hiring, there's still hope! One thing you can ask for in your contract is to have a performance review and subsequent raise down the line. This can work! My boyfriend negotiated a $3,000 raise 3 months into one of his old jobs. They weren't able to give him the starting salary he wanted, so he asked to get a pay increase after the 3-month probationary period if he'd performed well. The employer agreed and he got the raise!
