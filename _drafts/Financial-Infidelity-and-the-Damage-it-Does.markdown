Financial infidelity is when someone lies about or withholds important information about money. This dishonesty can happen within romantic relationships, between roommates or business partners, or within a larger family structure.  For the purposes of this article, I'll be largely focusing on romantic relationships. *(If you'd like me to write about financial infidelity within other relationship structures, let me know in the comments!)*

A 2016 Harris poll for the [National Endowment for Financial Education ](http://www.nefe.org/press-room/news/americans-confess-to-financial-infidelity.aspx)revealed that 42% of Americans admit to deceiving their spouses financially, up from 33% in 2014.

## What counts as financial infidelity?

Acts of financial infidelity are wide-ranging. The can be seemingly harmless, or severely damaging. This is different than having your own financial accounts. My boyfriend and I keep our finances separate right now, but we know what we each have. I actually recommend to my clients that they have some of their own money, even if they're married. Financial infidelity is very different than that. Wondering what counts?

## Why is financial infidelity harmful?

Money is already one of the leading reasons for divorce. Financial infidelity makes things even worse. Seventy-five percent of people say that financial deception has negatively impacted their relationship.

## What are some of the consequences?

## What you should do now

Your next steps obviously depend on the severity of the financial infidelity. If you or your partner have been stealing from each other, things might be unsalvageable.  But if you just need to start being more truthful with each other, there may be hope.

**1. Have the money talk.** First of all, if you're new to a romantic relationship, you should [have the money talk](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/have-the-money-talk) ASAP. Even if you and your partner differ when it comes to money, you should both be aware of where the other is coming from. It's important to get on the same page, so that no one feels like they have to be dishonest. And if you can't work through the differences, it's better to find out early on.

**2. Confront or confess.** If you're already in a serious relationship and you've discovered financial infidelity (or committed it yourself), approach your partner.

\*I want to point out that financial infidelity and financial abuse are not necessarily the same. If you are in an abusive relationship where money is being used against you, please [get help](http://www.thehotline.org/). If you are in this situation, you are not alone. One in four women experience domestic abuse in their lifetime. 99% of those women also experience financial abuse within the relationship. Abusers often use money as a weapon against their victims, making it difficult for the victim to leave the relationship safely.
