I talk a lot about voting with your dollar and only spending money on companies that share your values. Itâ€™s a very powerful action, and it allows you to speak up outside of the voting booth. Money also tends to talk, loudly. That's why boycotts work.

The April Money Circle was all about voting with your dollar, so I wanted to share ideas with you here.

## 1.  Identify your values

## 2. Switch banks

## 3. Buy from companies you believe in (within reason)

One of the reasons it's so hard to vote with your dollar is cost. Many businesses that live our values tend to be less affordable.

## 4. Volunteer

## 5. Donate to a cause

Stay tuned next week for a full piece on how to donate to charity when you're on a budget.
