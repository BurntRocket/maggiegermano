Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my monthly clients paid their fee.

* The September Money Circle meetup was on Wednesday.

* Dan got his bi-weekly paycheck today.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Tuesday, Dan and I booked our flights to Peru for November! Flights came out to be about $500 each round-trip, but we'll be applying points from our Capital One Venture card to cover the amount. I am soooo excited!

* 

* The September Money Circle meetup was on Wednesday, so I went to Trader Joe's beforehand to buy snacks. While I was there, I stocked up on a couple things for my kitchen too. 

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I re-published an old [ForbesWomen](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/cultural-background-affects-americans-ability-to-reach-financial-goals/) post about how cultural background can influence the financial goals that we're able to reach. 

## **What I’m Up To**

* This week, on the [Money Circle podcast](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/choosing-between-a-free-ride-and-independence/), I answered a listener question about whether or not they should live at home for free or get out and gain independence. If you're not already subscribed, you can find the podcast on iTunes, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, and more!

* I just published the [October Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-preparing-for-holiday-spending-tickets-72080062407)! We'll be gathering to discuss how to prepare for holiday spending weeks or even months in advance.

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I’ve launched the virtual [Money Circle membership group](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle), called the Inner Circle! With this program, people who don’t live in DC are now able to be more connected to me and Money Circle. And those who already attend in person can get even more support! Accessibility is incredibly important to me, so depending on your needs and your budget, there are three different tiers for you to choose from.

* I'm doing my biggest speaking gig yet in early October! Not only will it be a larger group than I'm used to, but it is also one of the highest paying gigs I've ever gotten. Plus, it's in Atlanta, which will be fun, since I've never been there before.

## **What I’m Reading**

I just started reading *[The Wedding Party](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42455873)* by Jasmine Guillory and I'm already loving it. I enjoyed her first two books, so I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. I am not disappointed so far!

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
