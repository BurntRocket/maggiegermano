Earth Day was on April 22nd, and this past Saturday was the [Climate March](https://peoplesclimate.org/). While pondering what more I can do for the planet, I was inspired to write this post. Hopefully it inspires you to make some changes in your own life.

In my former life, I was an environmental activist. In college, I ran two environmental organizations on campus. I was trained by Sierra Club and Greenpeace and even went to jail once for protesting at the State Department (my parents weren't pleased). I moved to DC primarily to be in a place where I could make a difference. When the [climate bill](https://www.c2es.org/federal/congress/111/acesa) failed in Congress in 2010, I was so disheartened. It's heartbreaking to dedicate your life to something that the government and big business don't take as seriously as they should. 

But we can still do things in our own lives that make an impact. In fact, the more of us who do that, the more of an impact it will make. This list is just a start, but every little bit helps.

**1. Use low-energy light bulbs and appliances**

**2. Turn off the lights**

**3. Use less plastic**

Plastic is actually the worst. As you might have heard, two dead sperm whales recently washed up on shore, with their stomachs filled with plastic. There's an island made of plastic floating in the ocean, and it's twice the size of Texas. Plastic takes at least 450 years (!!!) to biodegrade. So do your part by not buying bottled water or using plastic bags. Of course, you can't always avoid plastic all together. But if you do use plastic, make sure to recycle it!

**4. Walk when you can**

**5. Buy and donate used items**

**6. Switch to clean energy**

This one is obviously harder to do. We can dream of having a house covered in solar panels, but that's not always realistic. However, some 

**7. Buy local**

**8. Patron companies that prioritize sustainability**

Sustainability is becoming more popular. So not only is it better for the planet, but it's good for business too. The more people demand environmentally responsible practices, the more companies will adopt them. Try to buy from companies that already believe in sustainability. If there's a company that you love that could improve, ask it to to better.  

**9. Plant a tree**

This isn't always possible, especially if you live in a city like I do. I wish I could go outside and plant a bunch of trees in my yard! If you have a yard, plant some trees, and start a garden. You'll help take some [carbon](https://www.arborday.org/media/print/documents/10reasons/7X10.pdf) out of the atmosphere, and you'll be able to grow your own food. If you don't have the space to do this, support organizations that plant trees. Examples of these are the Arbor Day Foundation, One Tree Planted, 

**10. Call your representatives**

This is last but it's certainly not least. We need to show our elected officials that environmental protection matters, and we need them to support it. We need the EPA, we need to mitigate for climate change.
