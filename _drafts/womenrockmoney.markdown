Happy International Women's Day! Today is the day that people around the world celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. It's also a day to encourage efforts to improve the lives of women and girls everywhere. As a financial coach, I believe that financial security is one of the key drivers to women's empowerment. I use coaching and blogging as a way to provide women with the tools and support they need to take control of their money. Today, I'm presenting my most important money advice to help women get started on their money journey.

## Know Your Stuff

Knowledge is power, truly. It's really easy to avoid and ignore your financial issues, but that keeps you out of control. It's important to push through the anxiety and get a good grip on what's going on with your money. So lay it all out there for yourself. Get a handle on [where your money is](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-create-a-budget-that-works-for-you/), what you owe, what's coming in, and what's going out. Just having the full picture will be the first step to regaining control of your finances. 

## Advocate for Yourself

It can be hard to speak up for yourself as a woman, since we've been socialized to be nice and not cause trouble. But no one but you can ask for what you need. It's important to ask for what you want in all aspects of your life, but especially when it comes to money. This will come up when you're [negotiating salary](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-pick-a-salary-number-that-works-for-you/) for a new job or when you're [asking for a raise](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-a-raise/). Or even when you're coming up with service rates if you're self-employed. It's scary to ask for more, but if you know what you want, you deserve to have it!

## Get Clear On What You Want

What is it you truly desire for yourself? Have you ever stopped to think about it? Sometimes it feels selfish or foolish to daydream and think about what we really want. But isn't that what life is all about?! What's the point of having your financial life in order if you don't get to do the things that make you the happiest and most fulfilled? Set some time aside, even half a day, to do some deep thinking about what you want for yourself. Here are some questions to get you started:

* What do you [value](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/do-your-habits-and-values-align/) the most?

* What activity makes you the happiest?

* What are you doing when you feel like you're making an impact?

* If you could do anything in the world right now, what would it be?

* If you could go anywhere in the world right now, where would it be?

* What is your dream job?

* What would you do if you didn't have any debt?

How are you celebrating International Women's Day today? Are you striking from work? Are you refusing to do any housework? I'm going to a [fundraiser](https://www.facebook.com/events/277506966117621/) of [Planned Parenthood of Metro Washington](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-metropolitan-washington-dc)!
