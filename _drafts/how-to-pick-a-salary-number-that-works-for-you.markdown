A very common question I get is: how much money should I ask for?

It's hard for me to answer that question, because it really depends on the individual. Just like there's no [one-size-fits-all budget](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-create-a-budget-that-works-for-you/), there's no go-to salary number. Of course, there's an appropriate range in each sector, but the exact number depends on you.

## How much do you need?

Look at your numbers. How much money do you need to earn to cover your minimum required expenses? 

## How much do you want?

## What does the sector pay?

Do your homework! Find out how much the typical salary is for the work you want to do.
