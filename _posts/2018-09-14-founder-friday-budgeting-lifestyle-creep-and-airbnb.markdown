Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had two different sets of Airbnb guests this week (which is a blessing, because we have to shut it down for a week or two to renovate the bathroom shower).

* The income from my [budgeting workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) this weekend should process tomorrow. [Sign up](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) if you haven't yet!

* I had a new client pay for a 90-minute budget deep dive session. (Does this sound like something you'd be interested in? Schedule a [free discovery call](https://maggiegermanofinancialcoaching.as.me/discovery)!)

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* The [Hungry Harvest](https://www.hungryharvest.net/) delivery from last Friday was charged to our credit card this week. If you want to get $5 off your first order of rescued produce, [use my link](http://hharvest.net/m5didTk)!

* On Wednesday, I met with a friend of mine who is a social media strategist. We've been trading services to each other for a few months. We ordered Thai food for dinner while we talked through Facebook ads and upcoming social media strategies.

* In preparation for Hurricane Florence's landfall, we stocked up on some extra groceries and water this week. We also bought taco fixings for dinner last night, to celebrate [Taco Thursday](https://dcabortionfund.org/events/) and we donated some money to [DCAF](https://dcabortionfund.org/).

* As with every week lately, I bought several random wedding items. 

* I worked at a coffee shop yesterday and treated myself to some jasmine tea.

*Thanks to all the friends and family who came to my bachelorette party last weekend! I had a wonderful time and felt very spoiled. *

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I reposted my second [Women@Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano) post on my blog. I wrote about how to avoid lifestyle creep so that you are no longer living [paycheck to paycheck](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/5-ways-to-stop-living-paycheck-to-paycheck/).

## **What I’m Up To**

* I'm hosting my [Making & Breaking the Budget workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) TOMORROW, Saturday, September 15th! Have you always struggled with managing your money and sticking to a budget? You’re not alone, but it doesn’t always have to be this way! [Sign up](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) to join us! We’ll be gathering at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/) in Petworth, DC!

* The [September Money Circle meetup](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/starting-early-planning-and-saving-for-holiday-spending/) is scheduled and ready for you to sign up! This month, we’ll be meeting to discuss how to plan ahead and save for holiday season. See you there?
