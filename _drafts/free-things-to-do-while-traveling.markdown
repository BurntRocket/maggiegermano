Travel always seems like something that is so expensive. There's the transportation, the accommodations, the food, the activities... And yes, a lot about traveling IS expensive (unless you use [rewards points](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-use-credit-card-rewards-for-travel/)). But there are many activities that cost little or no money! Sometimes, those things can end up being the most rewarding as well.

## Tours

Last month, I was in Colorado for about a week. One activity I like to do while traveling is go on brewery tours. I'm a beer fan, and I always find it interesting to see what different breweries are like. The tours themselves are often free, even if you do end up paying for some beer. You can also look for things like winery or distillery tours. Don't drink? In Boulder, Colorado, you can do a free tour of the [Celestial Seasonings](http://www.celestialseasonings.com/visit-us) tea factory! That was probably the best tour I've ever done. Plus, all the tea for sale there was cheaper than it is in stores.

## Museums

Not all cities have free museums. In fact, I feel pretty spoiled having lived in DC for 8 years. We have so many free museums that I'm always shocked when I have to pay to go in one somewhere else. But

## Gardens

In Portland last week, I went to the International Rose Garden. It was beautiful AND free. Plus it gave us a great view of the city.
