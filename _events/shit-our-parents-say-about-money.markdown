This month, we are going to get real and talk about the shit our parents say about money. When I talk to people are their hangups about money, it usually somehow goes back to what their parents did or didn’t teach them about money. There’s shame. There’s hypocrisy. There’s silence. Let’s dig into how these lessons have impacted our own lives and relationships with money. If your parents taught you great lessons about money, bring those to share as well!

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they have around money.

There will be snacks, wine, and tea for all. This event is very casual, and all you have to bring is yourself and openness.
