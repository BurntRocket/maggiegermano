Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* I held a workshop at the Lemon Collective this Wednesday. We had a great turnout!

* We had two Airbnb guests this week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* As you probably saw last week, my husband and I got a puppy over the weekend! We've named him Bruno and he's adorable and sooo much work. We're quickly learning how easy it is to spend lots of money on a puppy. On Monday, we took him to his first wellness exam at the vet, which cost $99, including the price of one vaccine.

* We also signed Bruno up for pet insurance through [Healthy Paws](https://refer.healthypawspetinsurance.com/MaryG). We paid for his first month's premium on Monday.

* We bought Bruno a new leash because the one we had bought was too heavy and would distract him whenever it touched his back. We also ordered him a stuffed animal to cuddle and  play with while he's locked in his pen while I'm working. We ordered him 6 months worth of heartworm and tick/flea prevention medication. (Again, pets are expensive!)

* We went grocery shopping on Sunday and were charged for our [Hungry Harvest](http://hharvest.net/m5didTk) box from last week.

* We paid the remaining balance for our new privacy fence. Luckily, we have that money already set aside in savings.
