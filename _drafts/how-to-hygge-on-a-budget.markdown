Hygge is the Danish concept that means "coziness". It's pronounced "hoo-gah". 

I had never heard of hygge before last Friday. But then Emilie Aries of Bossed Up shared a video about it and then Alisha Ramos of girl’s night in posted on Instagram that she was reading about it. Then all weekend, dan and I obsessed over how we could make our home more hygge-like. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I need more comfort, warmth, and softness in my life and Home. And then, of course, my next thought was: that’s expensive! I don’t want hygge to only be available to those with plenty of money. I want everyone to experience hygge! \
