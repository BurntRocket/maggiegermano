On Tuesday, December 5, 2017, I told my boss that I would be resigning from my position at the end of the month. I was so nervous that my hands were shaking. I could even hear my voice trembling as I spoke. I had been pumping myself up to quit for days, and the anticipation was really stoking my anxiety. I was worried that my colleagues would be angry with me. I was scared that it wasn't the right decision. I was downright terrified that I would end up failing in my entrepreneur journey.

Once the words were out, I could feel my body relax with relief. My boss was surprised and definitely sad that I was leaving, but she was incredibly supportive. She knew I was running my business on the side, so she was excited that I felt ready to pursue it full-time. 

I had been running my business as a side hustle for nearly 2 years. So what made me finally pull the trigger and quit my well-paid, very stable job?

## I Want to Make an Impact

## I Was Running Out of Energy

For nearly 2 years, I was working full-time and running my business on the side. I would take client calls during my lunch hour or after work. I would stay up late and spend weekends writing or following leads. I spent most of my free time working in some capacity. 

I also bought a house with my fiance in October. That was after months of looking at houses and negotiating with the sellers. It was incredibly stressful. And now we are really diving into wedding planning, since we are getting married later this year. So, as it might seem, I was kind of running on fumes. I was running out of physical and mental energy to keep up with everything in my life. And it was starting to show! I have always prided myself for being very organized and having a great memory. But during the last few months of 2017, things were starting to slip. I was having a much harder time keeping track of things. The stress and business was taking a toll on my ability to get shit done. Something needed to give and I decided that was my day job.
