Ah, a brand new year. It's that time when we all set New Year's resolutions and vow to be a new, better person. These goals are often lofty and not always realistic. *"Lose 50 pounds in 3 months! Never eat sugar again! Stop procrastinating forever!"* More often than not, we find ourselves abandoning these goals a few weeks or months down the road. It's totally human, because  you can't change who you are overnight. But it doesn't have to be this way! You don't have to set unrealistic goals that you give up and then feel bad about.

Like I said [last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/reflecting-on-2017/), it's important to acknowledge your wins from 2017 before you set new goals for 2018. This exercise will show you just how successful you were, even if you didn't realize it while you were living it. You'll feel better about yourself and more confident about what you can achieve in 2018. When you feel self-confident, your goals will be centered more around realistic changes and achievements, rather than focused on completely changing who you are. 

Are you not sure where to start when it comes to financial goals for 2018? Here are some easy (or not so easy) goals to start with this year.

## Talk About Money

Okay. This isn't *easy*, per se. But it is so, so important. Money talk has been considered taboo for so long, that most of us live in shame when it comes to money. We feel isolated and alone in our financial struggles, because we don't know that our friends are having the same exact problems. We overspend because we're too embarrassed to tell our friends that we can't afford to go out to dinner. the list goes on. 

Silence around money only leads to problems. It means we don't have the support we need when tackling our financial goals. It means that the wage gap goes unknown and unchallenged in the workplace. It means that we hide our debt and spending habits from our loved ones until it's out of control. 

So, in 2018, start talking about money. Be honest with your friends when you can't afford to go out this week. Tell your best friend about your credit card debt (I'm sure she has some too!). Most importantly, talk about your financial goals. Be vocal about what you want to achieve this year. Share it in Money Circle! When you've said your goals out loud, or written them down, you're more likely to achieve them. You'll get the support and accountability that you need! And you might even show someone else that they aren't alone either.

## Be Honest With Yourself

*Okay*, this one isn't that easy either. Facing our own shit is one of the hardest things we can do. But it's really the only way to achieve longterm success. If you aren't aware of your own issues, habits, and hang-ups, you won't be able to get past them. And this applies to every area of life. 

For example, just a few short years ago, I had what I considered to be "terrible luck" in my dating life. The guys were always unreliable, nothing seemed to last. "Why me?!", I would often ask. Things didn't change until my acupuncturist asked me if I'd ever thought about why I tend to surround myself with people who don't treat me well. It was like an actual light turned on in my brain. It was true! I was subconsciously seeking out these unfulfilling relationships because I was afraid to find something real. Literally days later, I reached out to the guy who is now my fiance. But I couldn't get myself out of my situation until I realized what I was actually doing.

So how does this apply to you and your finances? Well, it can sometimes feel like we just have bad luck financially. And that can be true! However, oftentimes our own beliefs and habits are the cause of our financial problems. Financial unrest is often a symptom of emotional issues. I'm sure we've all gone on 

## Look at Your Accounts

Just like I said above, you can't change anything if you don't face it first. And part of facing your financial issues is actually knowing what is happening with your money.
