Happy Friday, y’all! I hope you're getting ready for a nice, long weekend. Here’s what I was up to this week.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about [bankruptcy](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-does-bankruptcy-mean-and-should-you-file-for-it/) on my blog. I talked about what it involves, when you might want to consider it, and what the consequences can be.

## **What I’m Reading**

I'm still working my way through the cute romance novel *[99 Percent Mine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36300625-99-percent-mine)* by Sally Thorne. I've pretty much abandoned *[A Princess in Theory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35271238-a-princess-in-theory)* by Alyssa Cole but I picked up *[Ghosts in the Schoolyard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38923643-ghosts-in-the-schoolyard)* by Eve L. Ewing. It was this month's book for my book club, but I hadn't been able to get to it in time. I've picked it up now and it's very fascinating and sad. I recommend it if you're interested in learning more about Chicago, racism, and school closings.
