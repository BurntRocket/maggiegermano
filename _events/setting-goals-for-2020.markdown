I'm not a huge New Year's resolution fan. I always end up abandoning whatever resolutions I set. Plus, they always seem to be related to worrying what other people think of me, rather than what I personally really want to do.

However, I still think it's important to set goals at the beginning of a new year. Why? Because if you don't get clear on your goals, you won't be able to actually work to meet them. And goals are different than resolutions because they should align with the things that you truly care about.

So join us at the January Money Circle meetup to set your 2020 goals. And don't forget to be specific! We'll have some crafting materials and handouts so that you can get excited and creative with your goal-setting.

Don't have any goals in mind yet? That's okay! Join us so you can be encouraged and inspired by the other women in the room.

The location is currently TBD, but it will take place in Washington, DC, near a metro station. You will get an email once the location is confirmed.
