A credit score is a three-digit number that is calculated based on your credit report and credit history. It’s one factor that lenders use to determine your creditworthiness for a mortgage, loan, or credit card.

You should care about your credit score if you care about your future. Simply, in a lender’s eyes, the higher your credit score, the lower a risk you are to them. Depending on your credit score, the lender can decide if they consider you eligible for a loan, and it can impact the interest rates on those loans. If your credit score is high, you can luck out and get a lower interest rate, which will save you hundreds, if not thousands, in the long run.

In this month's Money Circle gathering, we'll be learning about how to improve your credit score. If you know you want to buy a house or a car, go back to school, or get any other kind of loan in the next couple of years, it's important to understand your credit score and take the steps to improve it.
