If you are not located in the DC area, or if you just want more connection through Money Circle, this program is for you. There are 3 tiers that offer different options at different price points. There is a group coaching component and even a level that lets you check in with me every month. **[Sign up today!](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)**
