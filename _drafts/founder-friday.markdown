## How I Earned Money This Week

* None of my clients' payments went through this week, so all my earnings are from Airbnb!

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Three monthly subscription payments for my business went through this week, and I also spent some money on snacks for Money Circle, as well as a Lyft home from the event.

* On Sunday, Dan and I drove to Leesburg, Virginia to see our friend and wedding officiant, who was in town for a wedding. We went to [Vanish Farmwood Brewery](https://vanishbeer.com/) for a few hours and had some beer and too much food. 

* On Monday, we went to another brewery, [Atlas Brew Works](http://www.atlasbrewworks.com/), in DC for the Safe Space Jam! If you weren't able to make it to the event, you can still [donate](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/collectiveactiondc) to [Collective Action for Safe Spaces](http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/), if you want to support their efforts to make DC a safer space for all. I was an official sponsor for the event, but we also bought a few extra beers.
