Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* We are freshly back home after being in Peru for 10 days. On Sunday, we paid to get to the airport in Lima, bought some snacks in the airport, paid for our parking at Dulles Airport, and bought McDonald's on the drive home.

* On Monday, I did a simple grocery run at Whole Foods so that we'd have enough food for healthy, easy meals this week.

* I went downtown on Wednesday for some meetings and for Money Circle. I had to add money to my metro card and I bought some tea, a couple glasses of wine, and some snacks for the Money Circle attendees.

* A few months ago, we received a speeding ticket in the mail (it was Dan driving, not me!). It was a $200 ticket, which isn't something we wanted to pay. We contested the ticket, but we just got another letter from DC saying "too bad, you have to pay up". So I paid that ticket this week in order to avoid any late fees. Luckily, we started saving up for car expenses, so if that $200 ends up not fitting in our monthly budget, we can pull from that account.

## **What I’m Writing**

* On the blog, I wrote about how you can make sure that you're getting [exactly what you need](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-make-sure-you-get-what-you-need-during-enrollment-season/) from your health insurance plan.

* Before I left for Peru, I published a piece on my [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2019/11/08/women-hate-open-enrollment-season-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be-that-way/#2f5118f362ee) column. It's all about how stressful we find open enrollment season, and how we can make it a little bit easier for ourselves.

## **What I’m Saying**

* This week, I switched away from the healthcare conversation and talked about how you can [financially prepare to get a pet](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/preparing-for-pet-costs/). 

* Fill out [this questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform) to submit your own money questions for the podcast.

## **What I’m Up To**

I’ve created a virtual [Money Circle membership program](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)! If you are not located in the DC area, or if you just want more connection through Money Circle, this program is for you. There are 3 tiers that offer different options at different price points. There is a group coaching component and even a level that lets you check in with me every month. [Sign up today!](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)

## **What I’m Reading**

I'm reading a couple books right now. Last night, I started *[The Witches Are Coming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38362811-the-witches-are-coming)* by Lindy West, who is one of my favorite feminists. If you haven't read her first book, *[Shrill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29340182-shrill)*, you must. I'm also reading *[A Tale for the Time Being](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15811545-a-tale-for-the-time-being?from_search=true&qid=Px41rJFGTq&rank=1)* by Ruth Ozeki.
