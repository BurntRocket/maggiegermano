Happy Friday! I hope you survived the week without too much stress. 

## How I Earned Money This Week

## How I Spent Money This Week

* On Sunday, I met up with my friend Nina for tea and some shopping. I had a coupon for a free drink at Bakers and Baristas, so I only spent $3.50 on my chocolate croissant. Then we went to LOFT, where I spent $60 on a blouse and a cardigan. Each item was originally $50, so I got a great discount. I've been slowly trying to create a wardrobe that I'm happy and confident in, so I'm glad that I was able to find two pieces that I like!

## What I'm Writing

It's tax season, so [I wrote about](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-do-your-taxes/) how to get started on doing your taxes. It doesn't have to be the most stressful time of year!

## What I'm Excited About

* Dan and I booked our [wedding photographer](http://www.barbaraophotography.com/) and I officially bought my wedding dress (with tax, it was $254.40)! When things start getting done and I can cross them off my list, this all feels a lot more exciting and real.

## What I'm Fan-Girling Over

* Loving the Stuff Mom Never Told You episode about whether marriage can be feminist. Bonus: Jill Filipovic is the guest! Can't wait to read her book, *[The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/H-Spot-Feminist-Pursuit-Happiness/dp/1568585470)*.
