## What I’m Up To

* My panel has been chosen for this year's [FinCon](https://finconexpo.com/) in Washington, DC! I'm excited to join [Cait Howerton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caithowertonmba/), [Kelsa Dickey](https://fiscalfitnessphx.com/), [Ericka Young](https://www.tailormadebudgets.com/), and [Holly Morphew](https://www.financialimpact.com/) on the stage.

* The [April Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-honoring-self-care-keeping-your-pockets-full-tickets-59004572264) meet up is ready for registration! We’ll be joined by Megan Sanchez of Upswing Health Coaching to talk about prioritizing self-care while on a budget.

* My friend and real estate agent, [Liz Ho](https://www.rlahre.com/agent/liz-ho/), and I are hosting a buyer’s salon in DC on Wednesday, April 24th. Keep your eyes peeled, because we’ll be sharing the sign-up link soon!

* I want to hear from you! As I am continuing to create blog content and expanding my work into online courses, a podcast, and more workshops, I want to make sure I’m creating things that are useful to YOU. I’ve made a survey for my clients and readers to hear about what you most want to learn about.

## What I’m Excited About

* I’m going to Vermont this weekend! In fact, I’m definitely at the airport right now, getting ready to board my flight. It’s for my friend’s bachelorette party, and I can’t wait to spend the weekend with a bunch of awesome ladies!

* I’m signed up to attend **[Statement](https://www.statementevent.co/)**, a gathering of women in money. I’m so excited to be part of a group of women who I am inspired by. If you’ll be in NYC from May 2-5, let me know!

* Dan, our puppy Bruno, and I are starting obedience training on Monday! Raising a puppy has been a lot harder than I ever expected, so I’m excited to get some support and guidance from experts! Plus, maybe this will help Bruno to stop biting us.

## What I'm Reading

I'm trying out a new section of this blog post! It's not money-related (usually) but it might be fun. I will be sharing what book(s) I'm reading at that moment and what I think of them. I know I like to hear what other people enjoy reading, so I thought you might enjoy the same from me.

This week, I am finishing up *[The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls](https://www.amazon.com/Care-Feeding-Ravenously-Hungry-Girls/dp/1984802437)* by Anissa Gray. It is also my book club's book of the month. I've sped through the book and I'm enjoying it, although it's incredibly sad.
