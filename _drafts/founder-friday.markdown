Happy Friday! I'm in Syracuse this weekend spending time with my family for Easter. But here's what I got up to this week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* Two new clients signed up for a one-time session.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I spoke at the [Own It Summit](http://www.ownitsummit.com/) at Georgetown University on Sunday, which was a great experience. Because there's no easy way to get to Georgetown from my house using public transportation, and I don't yet know how to drive Dan's manual car, I had to take a Lyft to and from the campus. It was a bit much to pay for my own speaking gig, so I'll have to come up with a better solution for getting to Georgetown in the future.

## **What I’m Writing**

I wrote a post that was a little lighter and more fun this week than the past **[two](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/the-truth-about-the-wage-gap/)** **[weeks](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/the-financial-impact-of-sexual-harassment-abuse/)**. Instead of talking about what is holding women back, I wrote about the **[amazing women](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/women-who-broke-the-glass-ceiling-in-their-industry/)** who have pushed through the bullshit to succeed in their own careers. Who is your favorite trailblazer?

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I was featured on the [Idealist](https://idealistcareers.org/financial-coach-women/) blog, talking about how I made my transition from the nonprofit world to entrepreneurship. 

* I’m leading a personal finance workshop at [Varnish Lane](https://varnishlane.com/) nail salon for their first Varnish Lane After Hours event! Join us on **[Thursday, April 5th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/varnish-lane-after-hours-personal-finances-tickets-44203571071)**!

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

That’s all from me for this week! Enjoy your weekend!
