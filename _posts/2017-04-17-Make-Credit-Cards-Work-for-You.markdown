Credit cards get a bad wrap. We are taught that they are inherently bad and to avoid them at all costs. But what if you could make your credit cards work for you? I think you can!

Before I get into how to get the most out of your credit cards, there's a step you must take. Know thyself. Be fully aware of and honest about your habits and any money issues you have had in the past. If you struggle to pay back your credit cards in full, using rewards cards may not be the best choice for you.
 Of course, there are ways to mitigate those issues, and I'll get into that later.

There are a few reasons that credit cards are great. First of all, they help you build your credit history. If you've gone through your whole life without any credit cards or other loans, you won't have any credit history. This impacts your credit score, and will hurt your chances for being approved for other loans like a mortgage or personal loan.

Another reason that credit cards are great are the rewards that come with them. I went too long in my life only using my debit card or credit cards that had no rewards program. 

If you trust yourself to manage credit cards well, there are a few rules to follow. 
\

\
Always pay on time. If you don't trust yourself to remember, set up auto-pay. Otherwise, set a calendar reminder for your due dates.
\

\
Always pay off your balance. Interest rates on rewards cards tend to be sky high. That's how the companies are earning money while also giving you points, miles, and cash back. If you pay off your balance in full each month, you won't incur the high interest.
\

\
Keep track of your one year anniversary. Many rewards cards have no annual fee for the first year of having the card. Once that year is up, you will be charged anywhere from $50-450, depending on the car you have. If you don't want to owe an annual fee, make sure you either call and ask them to waive it for another year, ask them to downgrade you to the no-fee card, or cancel the card all together. Note: Closing a credit card within a year won't seriously hurt your credit score. It's your older accounts that matter the most.
\

\
Keep track of all of your cards. Having multiple credit cards can be great if you're taking advantage of all the rewards. But if you lose track of which cards you owe money on, you can get yourself into trouble. Missing payments can hurt your credit score, which can hurt your credit worthiness later on.
