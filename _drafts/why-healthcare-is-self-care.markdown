I hear about self-care everywhere I look these days. And it's a good thing, we all need to take better care of ourselves. There's always so much information coming at us, and busyness is an epidemic. We don't make a lot of time to actually slow down and take care of ourselves. So I really support the push for self care. However, it's important to remember that investing in healthcare IS self care. Here are all the things you have access to if you have health insurance and take advantage of it. 

## Annual Physicals

Preventative medicine is so, so important for long term health. I think our country is just now catching onto the idea that we should be able to keep ourselves healthy *before* we get seriously ill. This is why preventative care, including annual physicals, are now fully covered under the Affordable Care Act. 

You should go to the doctor at least once a year to get all of your blood work and other tests done. This can show if there are any potentially serious problems that you might be able to manage or prevent. It can also give you the peace of mind that everything is fine and you don't have to worry about your health. 

## Women's Health

Every woman should go to the gynecologist every year. Some experts say that women only need a pap smear every three years, but since an annual exam is covered by insurance, why not go every year? These exams can catch sexually-transmitted infections, pre-cancerous cells, cancer, and other issues. This visit also includes a breast exam, which can find any potentially dangerous lumps. 

Yes, going to they gynecologist is the worst. In fact, it can be downright traumatizing for some people. I wish there was a better way for us to make sure we're healthy. However, I always breathe a sigh of relief after my annual gynecological exam. As a borderline hypochondriac, I assume that the doctor will find something scary. So going every January is a way to calm my anxiety and confirm that I'm taking good care of myself. 

## Mental Health Services

I've said this previously: mental health is just as important as physical health. There are so many people who can't afford to go to therapy or a psychiatrist. Many people will mental illness are completely failed by our systems or lack thereof. It's a stain on our society and leads to increased rates of homelessness, . 

## Access to Medication

## Sick Visits

How many people do you know who never go to the doctor, even when they're sick? Are you one of those people?
