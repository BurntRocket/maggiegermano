Just in time for Valentine's Day, there's been [a study](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123005479/en/Stop-Arguing-Financial-Tips-Couples) released by Elevate’s [Center for the New Middle Class](https://newmiddleclass.org/blog/) about love and money. As you may have heard, financial problems are one of the leading causes of relationship strife. But it doesn't have to be that way! I'm a [huge proponent](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/have-the-money-talk) for talking openly about money with your partner (and everyone else in your life!) Money touches every part of our lives, so it's important to get on the same page with the person you're sharing your life with.

Do you, like 21 percent of the marriages in this study, exhibit behaviors of unhealthy financial partnership? This can look like:

* Failing to reach financial compromises

* Not comfortable talking with each other about finances

* Feeling that their partner does not support their financial goals

* Not understanding each other’s position in arguments

But it doesn't have to be this way! Even if this is how your relationship has felt so far, there are changes that you can make to improve things.

## Discuss Your Financial Goals

One of the most important things in a relationship is to talk about your goals together. You individual goals and your goals as a couple. You  might learn things about your partner that you didn't know before! Plus, if you're working on goals together, you'll feel more like a team.

## Define Family Goals, If You Have Them

Do you want to have children someday? Do you want to buy a home? According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the cost of raising a child to the age of 17 is roughly $250,000. That's a lot of money, even if it's spread over 17 years! It's important to be in agreement with your partner about big decisions like this one. Plus, you might be surprised to learn things about what your partner does or doesn't want in the future, especially if you've never discussed this before. 

## Be Transparent

According to the survey, 24 percent of respondents say they are not confident that their partner is entirely honest about their spending with them. Wow! That's almost a quarter of respondents.

Of course, you don't have to report back to your partner for every dollar you spend. That would be obnoxious. And if you have a partner who demands that, there might be a [much bigger issue](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/financial-abuse-survivors-want-you-to-know) at hand.

## Combine Some of Your Finances

I personally am not a proponent for combining *all *of our money in a romantic relationship. This opinion mostly comes from my overprotectiveness of women and wanting them to have their own financial security in the case of a relationship dissolution. 

## Be Empathetic
