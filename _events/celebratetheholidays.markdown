You want to show your love, give gifts, and visit friends and family for the holidays. But do you usually find yourself in debt or financial ruin by New Years Day? Many people do. It doesnâ€™t have to be that way. Join us at Money Circle this month to share money-saving ideas!

Since this is a brunch-time Money Circle, I will be providing mimosas and baked goods.

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they have around money.
