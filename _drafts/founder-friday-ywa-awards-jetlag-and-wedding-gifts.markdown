Happy Friday! I'm back from my honeymoon and ready to start reporting back about my week again. Do you find these weekly reviews useful or interesting? Let me know in the comments!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We're back in the Airbnb game after taking November off while we were gone. We had one guest stay with us this week.

* A few of my clients' monthly payments went through this week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* After 3 weeks away, Dan and I were lacking in fresh food and produce. We went to Safeway and stocked up on healthy ingredients for multiple crockpot meals.

* I went through a bit of a Christmas craze this past weekend. Dan and I bought a real Christmas tree from a Lutheran church down the street, bought a fake wreath and garland from Home Depot, and went a little overboard on cute stuff at Target. The living room looks so cozy now and most of what we bought are things we can reuse every year.
