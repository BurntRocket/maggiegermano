Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We had a guest and his wife stay in our Airbnb until Wednesday this week. We have another guest arriving tomorrow and she's staying for a full week.

* No business income this week, but I'm hounding two clients who need to pay their invoices, so fingers crossed!

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I sent the final payment to both our photographer and florist this week. It doesn't feel great to be writing huge checks to multiple people, but it's nice to know that we already have all that money in the bank.

* Dan bought the dress shirt he's going to wear at our rehearsal dinner. It's a really pretty, busy floral shirt that is exactly what he was looking for. We also bought a couple more wedding-related items. They were fairly low cost, but these things do add up, so I'm hoping we don't have to buy anything else!

* We bought some more paint from Home Depot to finally paint our guest room. It's been a pale yellow that had become very discolored, so it feels good to repaint it. We also bought a new ceiling fan for that room, because my parents complained a little bit about it being stuffy in there.

* I spent a lot of time working outside of the house this week. I somehow had meetings almost everyday this week. So I bought myself quite a bit of tea.

## What I’m Writing

This week, I got real about the money I've been spending on improving my house. I mostly focused on the money I don't regret spending, but I also talked a bit about the times I was a little foolish. And I'm sure there will be more times! [Check out the piece](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/money-i-dont-regret-spending-on-my-house/) and let me know what you think!

## What I’m Up To

* I was featured on the [Wild Cozy Truth podcast](https://www.wildcozytruth.com/single-post/2018/10/11/Episode-61-Why-Personal-Finance-is-a-Feminist-Issue-with-Maggie-Germano) with Renee M. Powers this week! We chatted about feminism, money, homebuying, and more. I loved chatting with Renee, so check it out and let me know what you think!

* I’m participating in a salary negotiation workshop for the [Public Leadership Education Network](https://plen.org/) (PLEN) on Saturday, October 20th. I’m excited to chat with college students about negotiating for their future.

* I’m joining Emilie Aries for a [live podcast taping](https://www.facebook.com/events/177486379757315/) of the Bossed Up podcast on Monday, October 22nd! We’ll be talking all about women and money. Tickets are free - [see you there](https://www.facebook.com/events/177486379757315/)?

* Next month, [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) is meeting to talk about [how to ask for a raise](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-ask-for-a-raise/) at your current job. If you know you’ll have to do this soon, [join us](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-ask-for-a-raise-tickets-49618103082) on October 24th!

* If you can’t make it to Money Circle this month, join us in [December](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-plan-for-holiday-spending-tickets-50456857820) to talk about how to plan ahead for holiday spending. You’ll be super prepared for next year!

## What I’m Excited About

* My [speaker page](https://www.maggiegermano.com/speaking/) is up and live on my website! I’m expanding my business to include more public speaking and workshops. I want to reach more women to spread financial literacy at a level that is more affordable and accessible for them. [Check it out](https://www.maggiegermano.com/speaking/) and reach out if you’d like to hire me for your event!

* Dan and I are heading to Los Angeles this weekend. I'm excited to meet up with a couple ladies in finance and get to know them better. I'm also super excited to go to the live show of Put Your Hands Together. If you haven't yet checked out that podcast, what are you waiting for??
