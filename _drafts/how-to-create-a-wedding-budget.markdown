At one point in my life, I almost considered myself a professional wedding guest. My now fiance and I went to eight weddings in one year a few years ago. Now, we're in the midst of planning our own wedding. I knew the wedding industry was expensive, but I had no idea just how expensive it is until I started this process myself. Costs can quickly get out of control, so it's important to create a budget for yourself up front. It's also important to be realistic about the costs for the type of wedding you want. Here's how to create a wedding budget so you don't lose control of your spending, and can enjoy your special day without going into debt.

## Figure Out How Much You Have

## Decide How Much You Can Save

## Get Clear on What Matters to You and your Partner

## Find Out How Expensive Local Vendors Are

## Open a Savings Account Specifically for Your Wedding

## Automate Deposits into the Account
