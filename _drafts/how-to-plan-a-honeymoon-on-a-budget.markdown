I'm on my honeymoon right now! Well, I'm actually in the air or in an airport somewhere. We left DC late last night and are en route to Thailand for a three-week honeymoon adventure! You can keep track of what we're up to by following my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maggiegermano/).

## Start Planning Early

We decided where we wanted to go on our honeymoon at least a year ago. This gave us a lot of time to plan and save for our trip. It's unlikely that you could just up and go to Thailand for three weeks if you haven't been planning and saving for a while. (Unless, of course, you keep a full travel savings fund at all times.)

## Save, Save, Save

I know you're probably saving everything you have right now in order to pay for your wedding. However, it's important to remember that you'll want to save up for your honeymoon too!

## Take Advantage of Rewards Programs

I don't usually recommend points churning to my clients, because rewards credit cards have high interest rates that overrule any rewards you get. However, if you trust yourself to pay off your credit cards in full every month, rewards programs can be incredibly helpful. If you are loyal to certain airlines or hotel chains, getting their credit cards might be a good idea. The 

## Keep Track of Deals

Once we knew where we wanted to go, it was time to start tracking good deals. The most expensive part of our honeymoon was the flight to Thailand and back, so I wanted to make sure we were getting the best deal. I used platforms like [airfarewatchdog](https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/), [The Flight Deal](https://www.theflightdeal.com/), and [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights) to save my desired route and get email alerts whenever there was a good price. This is how I was able to see when an affordable Turkish Airlines flight was available and book it before it changed. 

## Go Somewhere Close

Yes, we're en route to Thailand, but you don't have to travel to the other side of the world for your honeymoon. My parents went to Disney World for their honeymoon. Of course, this was in the 1980s when Disney World was a lot cheaper, but even now it would likely be a lot cheaper than Thailand. So if you're not all that interested in traveling to a faraway land, you can pick a place that's closer, easier to get to, and much more affordable.

## Delay

More and more of my friends are delaying their honeymoon for six months or a year. That's a great way to recoup some of the money you spent on your wedding and give you time to save up for your honeymoon.
