What’s your number? No, not that number. Your credit score! When was the last time you checked? Do you even know what it means? Many of us don’t know much about credit scores, but you better believe that I'm here to change that! 

This month, we will meet to discuss:
-What a credit score even is
-How to find out what YOUR credit score is
-Why you want a high(er) credit score
-What information determines your credit score
-How to improve your credit score
-How to get your credit report

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they have around money.

There will be snacks, wine, and tea for all. This event is very casual, and all you have to bring is yourself and openness.
