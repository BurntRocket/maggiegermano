Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week, even though it was pretty wet. Here’s what I was up to!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* No business income came through this week, but Dan's paycheck came through on Tuesday.

* We didn't have guests for most of this week, since one guest had to reschedule, but we'll be getting paid for a guest this weekend.

* I wouldn't count this as earning, but we got a little bit of money at my bridal shower on Sunday. We'll be saving it for our honeymoon.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* On Sunday evening, we drove back to Maryland from Syracuse after my bridal shower. We packed food from my parents' house, but we did have to stop once to fill up on gas. Luckily, Dan's car is pretty small, so filling it up doesn't cost a ton. (I'm dreading when we eventually buy a bigger car that will suit our lifestyle better.)

* The fee for last week's [Hungry Harvest](https://www.hungryharvest.net/) delivery went through this week. I don't love that they delay the charge by several days, because it makes it hard for me to track our grocery spending throughout the month. (If you'd like $5 towards your first order, use [my Hungry Harvest code](http://hharvest.net/m5didTk)!)

* I had a few friends over for dinner this week, which is actually the first time I've cooked for guests in a while. Dan is usually the one to cook for our guests, but it was a ladies night this time. I bought a chicken to roast, since the rest of the group brought sides and wine to share.

* We purchased the transportation that will take us from Koh Lipe to Chiang Mai in Thailand during our honeymoon. We will have to take a ferry to the mainland, a van to the airport, and then we'll fly up to Chiang Mai. I'm relieved that [Air Asia](https://www.airasia.com/en/home.page?cid=1) lets you book a package for these different transportation options, so I don't have to find and book them separately. Plus, we're only paying $175 for both of us to take that trip up north, which I think is a great deal.

* A couple months ago, I gave in and bought the iPhone 8. It's a great phone, except for the fact that there isn't a normal headphone jack. It drives me crazy when I want to charge my phone and listen to music at the same time. I bought a [$10 headphone splitter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CM6FJX4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?smid=A1VRLO3B21V3ZJ&psc=1) that will let me do both from now on!

## What I’m Writing

Last week, I wrote about filing for [unemployment benefits](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/should-you-file-for-unemployment/). After that blog went out, I got an email from a follower asking for more information about making good financial decisions while unemployed. So I decided this week to write about what you should and shouldn't do during unemployment. [Check it out!](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-to-do-and-not-do-when-youre-unemployed/)

## What I’m Up To

* I’m speaking at [Robert Morris University](https://www.rmu.edu/) in two weeks! There was a last minute cancelation at one of their orientation events, so I’m filling in to talk about money. I’m hoping to do more events like this, because it’s important to get your money right from a young age, and I want to reach women in college! So if you know of any universities who are looking for money experts, [let me know](mailto:boss@maggiegermano.com).

* I’m holding my first official workshop! On Saturday, September 15th, we’ll be gathering at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/) in Petworth, DC to learn how to budget! Sign up for the [Making & Breaking the Budget](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) workshop today!

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/) is planned and ready for registration! We’ll be focusing on homebuying for first-timers, and we’ll be joined by the wonderful real estate agent (and dear friend) [Liz Delgado-Steo](https://www.realliving.com/elizabeth-delgado-steo). Liz is great at breaking down the homebuying process into language you can understand, so this is a meetup you can’t miss! [Register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-homebuying-for-newbies-tickets-48132651055)!

## What I’m Excited About

* We're officially less than 100 days out from our wedding! That simultaneously feels like so soon and so far! I know the next three months will fly by, but I'm excited to finally reach the day! I already have all our invitations stuffed and addressed, and we'll be sending them out this weekend.

* [FinCon](https://finconexpo.com/) is coming up in less than two months! This will be my third time attending, and I'm really looking forward to connecting with my fellow personal finance nerds. I'm even thinking of spending my last day in Orlando at [Harry Potter World at Universal Studios](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/theme-parks/islands-of-adventure/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-hogsmeade/index.html#subnav-b). Have any of you been there? Is it worth spending a day exploring before I head back to Maryland? The one-day pass is pretty expensive so I want to make sure I'll love it before buying it.

* In cased you missed my announcement last week, I’m a new contributor over at [Women@Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/)! I will have my own column where I will share my tips and advice about how to get your money right. Check out my first post about [how to trick yourself into a budget](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2018/07/25/how-to-trick-yourself-into-sticking-to-a-budget/), and click “follow” on my [author page](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/#37ea97a87556) so you always know when I’m publishing.
