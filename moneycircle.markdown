## Find Your Circle

You feel ashamed of your financial circumstances and you feel alone in your money struggles. You don’t know where to turn for money advice and resources and you don’t feel comfortable talking about it to family and friends. You’re looking for a community where you can find nonjudgmental support that helps you find the motivation to change your financial situation for the better. The Money Circle membership group allows you to talk to people who have been in your shoes, but who don’t have a personal stake in your financial decisions. There’s so much shame surrounding money already, especially for women. In this safe, intersectional feminist space, we will break down that shame and build community and safety for everyone, so that you can find the support you need to gain control over your finances.

**Membership includes:**

* A private online community where you can share what’s working and what’s not in your finance, and get support and guidance from others going through the same things

* Monthly group coaching sessions where you and other members come together to discuss important financial matters and get coached on your specific issues (if you wish to be!)

* $100 off a one-time financial coaching session with Maggie Germano (a $500 value for $400!)

**Investment: **$49 per month (you can cancel anytime)
