## **What I’m Up To**

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-dealing-with-money-shame-tickets-66476917249) meetup is scheduled and ready for you! In August, we'll be talking about money shame, how others feel the same way, and how to improve our relationship with our money. [See you there!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-dealing-with-money-shame-tickets-66476917249)

* On Sunday, I was quoted in *[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/who-feels-rich/594439/)* about money satisfaction and who feels good about their financial circumstances. 

* I’ve been hinting at starting a podcast for a while now. But in order to make sure the podcast is interesting and helpful for YOU, I want to make sure I’m answering your questions. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit any and all money questions that you have!
