***Content warning: **this article makes references to abusive relationships, particularly those where financial abuse is in play. If you are experiencing financial (or any kind of) abuse, there is help out there for you. **You are not alone, and you are not to blame. **You can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at **1-800-799-SAFE**. Reach out to organizations like **[Purple Purse](http://purplepurse.com/)** and the **[National Network to End Domestic Violence](http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=14107&state_code=PG&open_id=all)** for information, resources, and support.*

I want to start this article by saying that I am not an expert when it comes to abusive relationships. I haven't worked in this field and I haven't experienced abusive relationships myself. So I will do my best in this piece, but if I miss the mark, please let me know. I also want to reiterate that you should reach out to advocates 

I wrote over the last two weeks about which financial hurdles keep women from leaving abusive relationships and what financial abuse might look like.
