Kelsey is a birth, postpartum, and postoperative doula, and the Founder of Rainbow Doula DC, a queer-focused doula collective in the DC area. She focuses on a culture of respect for all birthing people, and is hoping to shift the culture around birth to be more inclusive of non-binary and trans folx. She is passionate about an approach that is trauma-informed and rooted in consent-based care. Before coming to doula work, Kelsey worked in international relations and reproductive health advocacy.

## TRANSCRIPTION

**Maggie Germano 0:05**

Welcome to the money circle podcast, a safe space where women can learn about and better understand money so that they can take control of their finances and create a better financial future for themselves and their families. there and thanks for listening. I'm your host, Maggie Germano. And today I'm talking to Kelsey Carroll, who is a birth postpartum and post operative doula and the founder of remote doula DC, a queer focus doula collective in the DC area. In light of the COVID-19 crisis and the social distancing, it is resulting in I wanted to have Kelsey on to talk about how things are currently changing, and how pregnant folks can get the support and care that they need. If you're pregnant or hoping to get pregnant someday. This episode is for you.

Welcome, Kelsey, thanks so much for being here.

**Kelsey Carroll 0:59**

Thanks for having me.

**Maggie Germano 1:00**

So you and I actually talked, I think it was probably a couple months ago now, but that episode has not yet gone live. But I did want to have you come on again to talk about birth work and during times of COVID. So thank you again for taking the time.

**Kelsey Carroll 1:19**

No problem. It's definitely it's an interesting time. So I'm glad that we're getting the chance to catch up. Oh, yeah, me too.

**Maggie Germano 1:25**

And so, since folks have not heard your previous episode yet, why don't you tell us a little bit about who you are and what you do?

**Kelsey Carroll 1:32**

Absolutely. So my name is Kelsey Carroll. I am doing a trained doula birth, doula postpartum and post operative support care. And I also am the founder and owner of rainbow doula DC so we are a doula agency based in Washington DC that specializes in supporting queer and LGBTQ plus, folks. And so we do postpartum services, services, and increasingly now, online Classes.

**Maggie Germano 2:02**

Oh, great. And that brings me into my next question which was about, you know, how you and your business are pivoting during times of COVID. With social distancing and different kinds of restrictions being put into place at hospitals and things like that. How are things pivot pivoting for you right now?

**Kelsey Carroll 2:21**

So right now is definitely an interesting time to be a birthing person or to be working in birth work. And increasingly, depending on where you live or where you're located. various hospitals are only allowing one birthing person, sorry, one support person per birthing person in the labor and delivery room. What that means for doulas is that we are increasingly offering online support virtual support. I myself am doing a lot more prenatal. So we are having a couple more touch points, with clients leading up to things with partners or clients, checking in seeing how everyone's doing but it's many kind of really shifting what it is to be a doula and what it looks like to provide support.

**Maggie Germano 3:06**

That makes sense. And that's something I've been thinking about just, I mean, I've never been pregnant. I've never given birth, but it is something I plan to do at some point. And I know that I definitely want to doula and that that kind of support is really important to me. So I've been thinking about, like, what that would mean how things would kind of have to shift and I have a few friends who are pregnant and getting closer to the time when they're going to have to give birth and all of that. And so I know that there's a lot of fear and questioning, and worry around that like everybody wants to stay safe, obviously and keep others safe as well. But they also need support and they want it's really hard to give up the plan that you had set for yourself. So how are you kind of helping reassure people and support them just as much as you possibly can while still maintaining you know, Social distancing and keeping everyone safe?

**Kelsey Carroll 4:03**

Yeah, that's a great question. I think that so much of the information is changing so rapidly. So one of the most interesting things I think about COVID is that what the world looks like right now is very different than what it looked like a week ago. Things are changing so quickly. So one of the things that I've been doing is just increasing my sort of touch points with my clients. So just making sure that I'm doing a couple more check ins than I normally would. I've updated all the resource materials that I tend to send out with COVID specific updates. And then I also am just checking in to see how inundated folks are with COVID information is some of my clients are saying, I'm a person who manages stress by having the most information possible. And some clients are saying, I need to pretend this isn't happening. I need to just go about my daily business in order to improve my own stress. So it's sort of it's been navigating we're all learning together, which I think is really interesting. So I'm just really transparent with My clients that this is what I know, at this point, things may change. And then, as you mentioned, you know, shifting birth plans and things changing in terms of what people might have been picturing for their own birth. I'm trying to create a lot of extra space right now for folks to grieve the birth that they thought they were going to have. So for some people, that means having a whole team of people in the room that they thought was going to happen. I had I was speaking with a pregnant person recently, who was saying, you know, I feel kind of silly, because I'm so upset that my birth photographer is not going to be able to be in the room. And I really don't think that's silly. I think that we're all reacting to these things that we thought would happen. This person thought they were going to have photos of their birth, they were looking forward to it. They are going to have, you know, some iPhone photos now, which is great. But it's I think it's okay to say how this sucks. Because we couldn't have predicted this and it's hard. It's hard to adjust to.

**Maggie Germano 5:55**

Absolutely. And I think that that's something that's so important to remember because I think You know, I hear people saying, Oh, well, you know, I still have my job and so I'm, I'm in such a more privileged position than a lot of other people, so I shouldn't even complain. It's like, we could still all complain like, things happen even just small daily annoyances, it's okay to complain about things. It's the human condition really, especially during the time of something like this, where it's a global pandemic, most of us have never experienced something like this. And when it's shifting, especially as your life is changing with potentially welcome welcoming, like your first child or another child, to the family, whatever the case might be. I mean, I personally having a plan makes me feel better. So if things get shaken up, it's really hard for me to deal with and so if you add not being able to grieve those changes that I think it just puts pressure, more pressure on people.

**Kelsey Carroll 6:55**

Yeah, absolutely.

**Maggie Germano 6:57**

So you mentioned a couple Examples of like different things that you're kind of doing to shift What are some of your clients doing to kind of work around these new restrictions or just the new reality to still try to get, you know as much of what they were hoping to get through their birthing process as possible.

**Kelsey Carroll 7:18**

So I've been chatting a lot with clients about the things that you can control in your birth environment. And really, for some folks, being able to control even one aspect brings a lot of relief to the entire birth process, especially when something like a pandemic feel so out of our control. So there's still certain things that hospitals are open to allowing birthing books to bring in, you still can bring in your birth bag, and you can still have your own music your own. If you're someone who's interested in essential oils, you can bring a diffuser with some sense. I've been having people bring photos of loved ones that they can have with them in case they can't actually have those loved ones in the room with them. And then also things like If you want to bring an iPad and Skype someone in the room, or a smart device, and you know, have someone virtually be there, that can really make a lot of a difference. So it's small things, but it's things that, you know, are allowing people to have some sort of control some sort of familiarity.

**Maggie Germano 8:18**

I like that. Because even if it is, like you said something that small, it still makes a difference, especially right now. And when you were talking about the one client who can't have the birth photographer there anymore, it made me think of the person who did my wedding photos. She's doing screenshot photos. So like, I think what it looks like is like your facetiming or doing Google Hangouts or something like that. And so she's taking like screenshots on her phone or on her computer, while like couples are doing certain things together or like whatever kind of event, you want to have her photographs so that you're still able to get that like third person Documentation of special moments. And so that was the first thing I thought I was like, you could do something like that and just have the iPad in the room and the photographer's they're like taking screenshots and I'm gonna be perfect, but they'll still be different than you know, you just doing it yourself or your partner doing it for you.

**Kelsey Carroll 9:17**

Yeah, I love that. And what I love about that, too, is that right now, what I think is so unique is that partners are taking on so many more roles, and I think they might have taken on in other circumstances. And so to add to the partners play, you know, now you need to be the videographer and photographer and the doula, you know, and the only person in the room for much of the birth to kind of an end support person for the birthing person. It's a lot. So even just to have someone else who's in charge of like taking screenshots. I think that's a great idea.

**Maggie Germano 9:46**

Yeah, I think so too, because yeah, I didn't think too much about the pressure being put on the partner and the support person in the room. And, yeah, I mean, if they are the partner of the birthing person, they're going to be having a whole lot of life change. going on at the same time. And so there's a lot of emotion, a lot of pressure already and adding on top of it that they have to then be everything except for the medical professional to their partner. It can be really stressful. So yeah, trying to take even just the smallest things off of their shoulders, I think could be helpful too.

**Kelsey Carroll 10:19**

Yeah, absolutely.

**Maggie Germano 10:21**

And so yeah, what kind of tips are you giving to the partners when they're preparing to go through?

**Kelsey Carroll 10:26**

That is a great question. So one of the things I've done I've been doing a couple of different online classes for people. One of the ones coming up this weekend is a taught by a massage therapist who's just teaching face and scalp massage. Is it safe for pregnant bodies, it's easy to teach over a computer. You don't have to have like any medical necessarily knowledge to implement, and you can also do it on yourself. So if you're a birthing person who's birthing alone, which is sometimes the case if a partner comes in and test positive, they can't be in the room. So anyway, so going back some of the things I'm doing with partners. One of the classes I'm teaching is called DIY doula. So it's basically intended to be a crash course on some of my favorite doula techniques that would be safe to teach another person to implement. So what that includes is certain hands on the body comfort measure techniques. But a lot of that is just ask going through the many questions that they might have to check the Is this normal box. I think that anytime that a person is empowered to be able to say, No, this is expected, we were expecting this, this is normal. It creates a lot of comfort and just sort of create confidence in the room that can really help with the birth process. So some of the things that I'm teaching partners are, for example, how to communicate with nurses. Once you're in the hospital room. There is a little on call box that sits next to most birthing beds and in order to get the response as quickly and effectively as possible. There are certain things that you can say, to be able to effectively and clearly communicate. So it's little things like that, that makes people feel as though they can walk in the room and be like, Okay, I know how to navigate this room, I know how to be here for my partner that just allows them to kind of take a little bit of a deep breath and focus on being a support person.

**Maggie Germano 12:13**

I love that that is such a smart approach to this right now to is allowing people to get as much information as they possibly can, that maybe the doula would be the one bringing into the room normally, really love that. Because that would also give that sense of control to as much as possible and then just have them know that they'll be able to advocate for themselves and their partner at the same time. I think that that's incredible. You're doing that.

**Kelsey Carroll 12:38**

Thank you. And also, one of the nice things is it doesn't, it opens up the door to allow for something like when we're doing when I'm doing virtual support, which is something that I'm doing that I'm offering for birthing clients. It allows for us to say something along the lines of Okay, it sounds as though you're in this stage of labor, so maybe we can try out x comfort measure and the partner already we would have walked Through the partner, they would have practiced it already until the partner can implement. But they don't have to memorize and remember, okay, this stage of labor, let's try this and this and this. But they have some sort of familiarity, they're already at least exposed to this so that we can kind of like talk them through in a way that's not introducing brand new comfort measure and brand new environment and vulnerable setting, and global pandemic. So it just sort of like takes some of the pressure off.

**Maggie Germano 13:24**

Yeah, I'm sure that that is so helpful to. So yeah, so tell me more about those virtual resources or the virtual support that you're offering, whether it's before, during or after.

**Kelsey Carroll 13:35**

Yeah, so it definitely varies from client to client. What I'm doing right now is I'm electing to self quarantine. And what I'm offering to clients is that I can be present with them before in the lead up to their labor. So as they're laboring at home, something that a lot of hospitals are recommending is to labor at home for as long as you possibly can. Just to sort of cut down on how much hospital time That you have, how much hospital exposure that you have. And so I'm offering to be present for that some couples aren't comfortable with that. And that's totally fine. Everyone's comfort level varies, and I respect all comfort levels. But if that is something that they're comfortable with, that means that being present with them in their home in the lead up to their labor in the lead up to the point in which they would go to the hospital rather. And then once they transition to go into and being at the hospital, it looks like having me on speakerphone, perhaps having you on video. Again, it's kind of navigating these boundaries that we haven't had to navigate before. So I'm always very upfront with clients that what they agreed to when we talk prenatally in terms of virtual support might change in the moment. So a birthing person might have said, I want you on video, I want to be able to see you all that and then they're in the moment and they're feeling watched or they're feeling uncomfortable or something along those lines. So it's just very fluid. It's very, you know what feels good right now that can change And again, we're all just like learning it together. It's been it's been really interesting.

**Maggie Germano 15:06**

Oh, yeah, I bet. And I think flexibility is just the key for everyone right now you just have to kind of reevaluate what you're doing just generally in life, like everyone's work has gone online, pretty much anyone who can obviously. And then, you know, the different ways that we're socializing and just different ways that we're doing things right now. So obviously, there is a lot more flexibility in a lot of cases than maybe we previously thought and it sounds like that's also the case with providing doula services and just having to get creative and thoughtful about how you're still able to offer your support.

**Kelsey Carroll 15:44**

Yeah, absolutely. It's been it's been a very, like, interesting thing, I think, for I have at least one client. A lot of clients are having to make really difficult decisions, which is just kind of an added stressor in the birth world. I have at least one click And who is birthing in about six weeks or so who's electing to bring me as their one support person rather than a partner? And those are just a lot of really big, heavy decisions, you know, that are, of course, super personal. And, you know, to your point, it's good to be really flexible, because that might change in the moment, it might not. But you know, part of that is, for me being prepared on my side of things to make sure that I'm healthy and safe and well, and I'm making sure that I'm keeping up my quarantine to be available.

**Maggie Germano 16:34**

Yeah, that's great. And, and yeah, and I've heard people talking about especially where, you know, you mentioned in DC, you can only have one support person in the hospital. And I think the same as in New York state where my family lives as well. And obviously, it probably varies depending on where you are. And so I've seen that a lot of people have to make that decision where it's like, do I choose my partner or do I choose my doula because like, I always wanted to have my doula there. And so I just can't Imagine how difficult that is right now. And so my heart goes out to everyone who has to make those decisions. Yeah, it's really tough. And so what are some other things are like the main things that you think that pregnant people should know right now when it comes to how they should be taking care of themselves leading up to giving birth, what maybe some of their options are, when it is time to be giving birth and just kind of think like top level things that they should know right now?

**Kelsey Carroll 17:31**

Yeah, that's a great question. I would definitely I mean, a lot of I absolutely recommend that folks follow the CDC and w h o guidelines in terms of social distancing, just generally, but especially for a pregnant person and for a birthing partner. Right now, there aren't conclusive data about how COVID can be transmitted to if COVID can be transmitted to newborns in utero, so we don't really know that yet. We don't know if it can be transmitted the breast milk. So there are a lot of unknowns there. And so of course, if you're doing everything that you can to just not be infected yourself, then that's obviously the best way to protect the newborn. And just other things to kind of be aware of in terms of changing hospital procedures. Right now I've heard a number of different hospitals are not only testing all incoming folks into the labor and delivery Ward and their chosen support person, but then also doing continued testing and continued monitoring. So what that might look like depending on the hospital is having your temperature and your partner's temperature checked on the hour, for example, and temperature checking for birthing person is pretty common. But for the partner that might be something that's unfamiliar and might cause a little bit of stress. It's usually like pretty minimal and non invasive, but just things to be aware of that the birthing person and partner might be asked to be wearing a mask and you know, just other things that as long as you can get as comfortable those ideas ahead of time. You won't be facing a situation where you're walking into a delivery Ward, and all of these things that you weren't expected to be happening are coming your way. And it just is another way of kind of regaining control over your reaction about your expectations. And then in terms of pain mitigation, there are a couple of different things that are happening and again, vary so widely hospital to hospital. But one of the things that is pretty common is that right now, what hospitals are finding is that nitrous oxide, which is one of the options for pain medication, it's inhaled, is doing something interacting with the virus in such a way that when it's expelled in the air, it is more contagious or easier to catch. So they're not actually allowing that in the birthing room. So that's something that if a birthing person was anticipating using that for pain mitigation, you know, I would encourage them to start to think about other options. And then similarly, some hospitals are encouraging epidural usage. Because right now, a lot of anesthesiologists are they're limiting one anesthesiologist per labor delivery ward. There's just a limit on generally how many people are in the building at a time. Which might mean a delayed response. If someone needs an epidural and especially in the event of an emergency were unexpected c section where they might need a little bit more rapid exposure to an epidural and if there's only one person on board, then it might be a little bit more difficult. So from what I've heard, is that there are those folks who are being encouraged to use epidurals, I'm certainly not being forced on anyone but these just kind of things that might not have been the case if we weren't, you know, birthing in this time.

**Maggie Germano 20:47**

Yeah, thank you for sharing all of that. That is very good to know. And like you said, it varies wildly between hospitals and locations, I'm sure. But just generally understanding kind of what you can Expect or maybe the different questions to be asking regarding things like pain management and and all that that's really helpful because I'm, I'm sure one of the struggles right now is like you don't know what you don't know. And as things change every day, it's helpful just to know what things to be asking about more generally.

**Kelsey Carroll 21:17**

Yeah, absolutely. I think that's one of the best things that pregnant and expecting folks can do is just know what to be able to ask. So other things to kind of keep tabs on in your own hospital, or birthing center is if a parent or partner tests positive when they're coming in whether or not they will be allowed to interact with the baby following the birth. So in some hospitals, for the safety of the baby, they are moving there, the baby from exposure with the pregnant person. Some hospitals are not doing that. It really again, all just depends, but it's something to definitely be aware of.

**Maggie Germano 21:54**

Yeah, and so it sounds like that's it's even more important for both the pregnant person and their partner. To be self quarantining, leading up to the birth, so they're not getting exposed to the virus potentially, and then, you know, potentially not being able to interact too much with the newborn right away, actually,

**Kelsey Carroll 22:12**

yeah. Another thing that that folks might be able to do to kind of prepare better is that in most hospitals, once you're admitted, you stay so whereas it used to be the case that if you were having extremely long labor, or perhaps ended up having a C section, in which case you would be at the hospital for many days, the partner could kind of come and go or go get some sleep come back. That's not the case currently. So once you're in you're in, that might mean it planning a little bit better for your birth bag and making sure that there's someone at home to watch other kids or other pets. I'm currently with a couple that I was with for pre labor starting on Sunday, and so I was with them as they were laboring, then they went off to the hospital and they ended up having an emergency c section. Everyone's healthy and well and totally fine. And luckily, I was able to stay in the house with their pets during the four or five days that it's going to take for them to recover from that C section. And so it's things like that, you know, in this specific case, these folks might not have wanted family members or close friends who would normally come and be able to help and be in the home immediately after the birth to help. So it might include, you know, having a close friend that you can rely on and say, can you be available in terms of being safe and safe and healthy and well, in the event that we need someone in our home or in the event that we need some help right after birth.

**Maggie Germano 23:35**

That's a really good point. Because I think that's something that I mean, I'm sure a lot of people struggle with this in normal times of like having the right support systems after the fact to whether it's care for another child or a pet or just helping around the home and helping just generally getting support that you need. So this whole added layer of being careful about who you're allowing you You're home and who you're allowed to get close to and all that and a lot of people not being able to travel. Yeah. What are what are some more recommendations that you kind of offer for people who maybe they already have kids and they need support, but still again want to be safe?

**Kelsey Carroll 24:17**

Yeah, I would definitely so postpartum doulas, from what I hear in the general community are being extra vigilant right now about their own health, so that they can be available to families. So a lot of postpartum doulas will offer sibling care as part of their package. Anyway, so that's something that you can kind of ask about if you're interacting with a postpartum doula is about their sibling care. And so that might be extended to having someone in the home so that the birthing person and partner can go to the hospital and just knowing that this person is taking you know, their health really seriously so that they're not exposing you. And then similarly for family who might be coming in to town to help are having family come in maybe asking them to observe a quarantine period leading up to the due date. I typically leave a four week window two weeks before the due date and two weeks after the due date as sort of my window of opportunity for our birthing person to go into labor. So maybe seeing if that's something that is an option for them, if it's not an option for them. Maybe you have a friend who can do that for you that you trust. Again, maybe you're able to access a postpartum doula have someone professional in the home. I know that a number of overnight nurses are being again really just very specific and vigilant about their own care. So they can be available to families. So overnight nursing might be something that folks can check out. But it's definitely it's a challenge. I think. Virtual postpartum care is a bit harder than virtual birth support care since a lot of postpartum care is being physically present to care for the baby so that the parents can shower and sleep and feel normal. And you know, that part is harder to provide virtually?

**Maggie Germano 26:04**

Oh, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I've seen some people that I know who have given birth more recently, in the last couple of months, I've seen that they have they in their families have been self quarantining for periods of time, so that they can then like, come and meet the baby. And they're just trying to be as safe as possible without having to just have this, you know, endless unknowing of when they can come and see this new family member or provide support. And so it's good to hear that there are other there are ways to do that and to be safe, not be irresponsible, but still be able to be there for your loved ones.

**Kelsey Carroll 26:43**

Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's also giving people an opportunity to get creative in terms of what it looks like to provide care. So if you were a person who would normally be going to if you're a family member who would normally be going to a birthing person's home right after birth. Think about the things that you would be doing for that person to be supportive. If it's things like doing their laundry, or, you know, getting them groceries, maybe you can deliver groceries to them maybe and drop it off on the porch or have a delivery service to it. Maybe you can arrange for pickup drop off laundry services, there are definitely ways that you can, creatively and impactfully still create a network of care, even if you can't physically be in the room with the person.

**Maggie Germano 27:27**

I love that that's so true. And I think the creativity piece is just going to be so key for so many things right now. And, you know, remembering we don't have to, like just give up on helping each other or asking for help, because there are ways around being face to face with each other.

**Kelsey Carroll 27:46**

Yeah, exactly.

**Maggie Germano 27:48**

So you mentioned your DIY doula class that you have put out recently, or do you have other classes that you're offering right now that could be helpful for people?

**Kelsey Carroll 28:00**

Yeah, absolutely. So I'm doing the DIY doula class every two weeks. So that one's recurring. It's a great, it's a great opportunity for folks who have gone through childbirth education to brush up on what it is that they learned. Maybe they learned it months ago and were expecting to have a doula with them. So, you know, they kind of were like, well, we'll know this info, which I totally get, I would do that too. It's a good little Crash Course hour long class for partners and birthing folks. But I'm also having guest lectures, if you will, so I had a home birth QA recently. That was for folks who are concerned who were previously thinking about hospital birth, and are now considering switching to home birth so that they are birthing in an environment they feel they can control a little bit more. So that was with a home birth midwife, and also having a trained massage therapist. Do a face and scalp massage as I mentioned. So teaching folks some at home relaxation techniques, since the body is already under stress during pregnancy But now there's a lot of added stressors, just generally in the world. I'm also doing an online childbirth education class that will be available in early May. So that's a really great opportunity for anyone around the country to be able to take childbirth education, it's taught in neutral birth language. It's going to be taught in a way that centers the experience of marginalized folks. But it also is open to any any birthing person.

**Maggie Germano 29:28**

That's great. And I will definitely share all of that in the show notes as well, because I think all of those resources are incredibly helpful. Are there any other resources that you recommend outside of what you're offering right now?

**Kelsey Carroll 29:40**

Yes, absolutely. So evidence based birth is a website. That is basically they take all sorts of peer reviewed and scientifically backed articles on any topic you could possibly think of surrounding birth and they have been keeping a really close pulse on what we know in terms of data about COVID so they have an ongoing online resource, but they have also been putting out almost daily videos, where they're talking folks through things like what are your, you know, there's a birthing Bill of Rights. What are your rights as a birthing person? Do you have the right for example, to refuse an epidural or a fuse, and an episiotomy, which you do, but things like that, you know, what do you have the right to as a person in a hospital space, other tools just for birthing folks in general. It's a really, really great website.

**Maggie Germano 30:32**

That sounds really great. And I can't wait to check that out, too. So I'll link to that as well. And you briefly mentioned, you know, for folks that are considering switching over to a home birth. I've seen a little bit of that too. And I think obviously there's a lot to learn around that. And so are there resources related to home births that you recommend so that people don't kind of go into it blind?

**Kelsey Carroll 30:56**

Yeah, absolutely. And I can send you some of those resources in case I can't, you know, come up with any other topic off the top of my head, but generally some of the things, if that's something that you're interested in, that would be good questions to start with, and good places to start, is knowing whether or not you're a good candidate for home birth. So that includes lots of things like, are you a high risk pregnancy or not? Is this your first child? You know, first time delivering? Or not? Those types of questions are good things to be asking when interacting with home birth midwives. And then just asking lots of questions about emergency procedures, which hospitals would be the ones that would be in connection with your home birth midwife. So most midwives have really great relationships with neighboring hospitals in the event of an emergency, so that you have a backup plan, but just making sure that you talk through all of those things and get all of your questions answered, so that you're approaching it in a way that is safe and make sense.

**Maggie Germano 31:57**

That's great. Yeah. And I will share any other reasons Is that you have but that is that's very helpful because I, I think that people if that's something they want to look into switching over to I think just being as informed as possible and having the support you need there is going to be really key to that. So that'll be great to share too. Okay, well, is there anything else you want to make sure pregnant and soon to be birthing if people know or anyone who thinks maybe they will be pregnant during this period of time? Anything else that they should know?

**Kelsey Carroll 32:32**

I would just say that my heart absolutely goes out to any person who's pregnant right now, generally, just to everyone, it's stressful for everyone. But there are just so many added stressors things to think about little moments that could create grief. You know, for this process, especially if, if someone had in mind something that they just never anticipated doing this. So, just just that, you know, I'm really thinking of any pregnant immigrant person right now who is birthing in these conditions, and to maybe carve out a little bit of extra time for some self care and self love and that self care and self love might include grieving and being upset and being sad, like all those things are so valid. And just kind of intentionally creating some love and space and support for yourself even more so than you might have been doing in other circumstances.

**Maggie Germano 33:25**

That's great advice. I totally agree. So thank you for that. So you mentioned what you're working on and what you're, what kinds of resources you have coming out, but how can folks get in touch with you right now?
