I am often asked about the difference between "good" debt and "bad" debt. I put them in quotes because using qualifiers tends to make people feel bad about themselves, and I want to avoid that.  In my experience, all debt usually *feels* bad, because you owe someone else money, but not all debt is equal.

## What is "good" debt?

This type of debt is an investment that will typically grow in value or generate income over time. An example is student debt. The idea is that this debt will eventually result in higher income over the course of your life. Student loans also tend to have lower interest rates and the interest that you pay on federal loans is tax deductible. 

Taking out a mortgage to buy a home is also considered good debt. Similar to student loans, mortgages tend to have lower interest rates, and that interest is also tax deductible. Ideally, your home would increase in value while you own it, so if you eventually sell it, you'll earn back the interest that you spent.

## What is "bad" debt?

"Bad" debt is any debt that is taken out to pay for things that lose value over time and don't result in higher income. This type of debt also usually comes with high interest rates. Basically, you end up paying more than the cost of the original purchase. An example is credit card debt. If you keep a balance on your credit cards, the interest grows 

[Payday loans](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/multimedia/video/2013/payday-loans-explained) and cash advance loans are also considered bad debt. These, in particular, usually turn out very negatively for the borrower. Interest rates and fees are sky-high and many people are unable to pay them back in time, and the loan amount grows and grows. This can destroy a borrower's credit and wipe out their bank account.

Who decides if debt is bad or good?

All this being said, having a credit card is not a bad thing. If you pay off your balance each month, your credit score will not be hurt. The problem is when you have credit card debt over a long period of time, because you owe more and more to credit card companies. This can hurt your credit score and prevent you from building up savings.
