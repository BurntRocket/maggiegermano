I'm sure you can picture it: you get your mail just like any other day. You open a plain, white envelope. It's not clear what's inside before you open it. But when you rip it open and pull out the paper, you see:

What?! Who could be suing you? Can you really get sued via mail? As you scan the letter, you see that a collection agency is suing you on behalf of a creditor. This is scary, and it's meant to be. The important thing here is to take action. Don't shred the letter. 

## Confirm the Debt is Actually Yours

There are a lot of scammers out there, especially those trying to scare you into giving them money. (Have you ever gotten one of those phone calls saying you owe money to the IRS? Pro tip: those calls are NEVER real. The IRS only communicates via snail mail, on official letterhead.) It's no different when it comes to someone telling them you're being sued for your debt.

You may have one of two reactions in this situation: pay the bill right away so you don't get in trouble or throw the letter in the garbage and pretend you never got it. Neither of those reactions will help you in the long run.

Read the letter in full and identify the company that is actually suing you. Do you recognize the name? Perhaps it's the name of the credit card company whose card you couldn't pay and then was sent to collections.

## Ask for Proof

If you don't recognize the debt or the name of the creditor, respond to the letter immediately. There should be the name and contact information of the lawyer representing the plaintiff. Call them and ask for proof of the debt. Have them provide information like: the creditor name, the type of debt, the amount of debt owed, etc. I

## Ask for a Lower Settlement Amount

If you realize that you definitely owe the debt you're being sued for, you really should own up to it. I've read some articles where the writer tells you to fight the charge no matter what, but I don't agree with that. If you know it's money you owe, you should do your best to make it right. The good thing in this scenario is that the creditor has likely already sold your debt to a collections agency for less than you actually owe. That means that they will be willing to reduce the amount that you owe just so you'll be able to pay it back.

## Set Up a Payment Plan

Even if you get the creditor to lower your owed amount, you still might not have that much money lying around. If that's the case, you can set up a payment plan with them.

Make sure you ask for confirmation in writing that you've agreed to a lower payment amount and a payment plan. You want to have proof that you've done your due diligence to pay your debt back.

## Go to Court

If you still don't agree with the charge that is levied against you, you can go to court to fight it. In fact, if you're summoned to court and don't settle the charge ahead of time, you must show up. If you don't show up, the judge will almost certainly rule in favor of the creditor and you will owe the full amount. If you do show up, you at least have the opportunity to make your own case and show any proof you have if the debt isn't yours.
