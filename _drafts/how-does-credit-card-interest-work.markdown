Happy Financial Literacy Month! This is the month of the year that you'll probably be seeing financial topics discussed everywhere. Luckily, you're used to that from me. However, this month, I want to write in-depth about questions that I often get from my clients. Questions that don't always seem very straight forward, but are important to know the answers to. This week, I'm diving into credit card interest! It's the kind of thing that is talked about as if everyone understands it, but most people really have no idea. So here are the facts that will hopefully help you manage your credit card debt a little bit better.

## How Interest Rate is Decided

The interest rate for a credit card is determined by the credit card company. Most cards will have a percentage range, such as 16.24-24.99%. Where you will fall on that range depends on your credit score and credit history. 

Not sure what your credit score is? Get it for free at Credit Karma or Credit Sesame. Your bank might even offer the service for free too! And no, checking your score does not impact it.

## How to Avoid Paying Interest

The only way to avoid paying interest on your credit card is to pay off your full balance every month. 

## How to Lower the Interest Rate

Have you been a good customer, paying your bills on time and never missing a payment? Your credit card company has probably noticed. So give them a call and ask them if they can lower your interest rate. This is especially helpful if you are working on paying down a balance, so you don't pay as much in interest over time.
