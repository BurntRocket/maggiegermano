* I’m offering [20% off one-time financial coaching sessions](https://maggiegermanofinancialcoaching.as.me/onetimediscount) in the month of June! We’re halfway through 2018, and this is usually the time we realize we haven’t made progress on our goals for the year. If you want some help getting back on track with your finances, let’s talk! **There's only two days in June, so make sure you book your session ASAP!**

## **What I’m Up To**

* I was quoted in [The EveryGirl](http://theeverygirl.com/how-to-successfully-make-a-career-change-as-told-by-people-who-have-done-it/) this week! I talked about how you can prepare to make a big career change, even if you're scared.

* I had two different speaking gigs this week! On Tuesday, I spoke about financial savviness with General Assembly. On Thursday, I talked about adulting at WIN's Women Opening Doors for Women event. 

* The [July Money Circle meetup](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/investing-101/) is live! We’re bringing in expert Claudia Russell to talk about investing basics. Get your ticket and I’ll see you on July 17th!
