Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had two different sets of Airbnb guests this week (which is a blessing, because we have to shut it down for a week or two to renovate the bathroom shower).

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* In preparation for Hurricane Florence's landfall, we stocked up on some extra groceries and water this week. We also bought taco fixings for dinner last night, to celebrate [Taco Thursday](https://dcabortionfund.org/events/) and donate money to [DCAF](https://dcabortionfund.org/).

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I reposted my second [Women@Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano) post on my blog. I wrote about how to avoid lifestyle creep so that you are no longer living [paycheck to paycheck](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/5-ways-to-stop-living-paycheck-to-paycheck/).

## **What I’m Up To**

* I'm hosting my [Making & Breaking the Budget workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-breaking-the-budget-workshop-tickets-48317128833) TOMORROW, Saturday, September 15th! Have you always struggled with managing your money and sticking to a budget? You’re not alone, but it doesn’t always have to be this way!

## **What I’m Excited About**

The box itself features a one-of-a-kind collage in the spirit of feminist ‘zines from the 1990s and 5% of sales is donated to a new feminist organization each month. Group coaching and book discussion is facilitated through Facebook and Zoom video chat by **[Renee M. Powers](https://www.wildcozytruth.com/about)**, feminist life coach and host of the **[Wild Cozy Truth podcast](https://www.wildcozytruth.com/essays)**. **Get $10 off your first box with code MAGGIE10**.
