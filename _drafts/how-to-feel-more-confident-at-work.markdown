Do you ever feel insecure at work? Like you aren't really contributing to your organization? I've been there too! In fact, I think it's easy to fall into a rut and forget how great we are at our job. This self-doubt can not only impact us emotionally, but it can affect how we function at work. So let's get you back to your confident self with the tips below!

## Track your wins

Keep a brag list. Write down every single thing you've done well at work. Keep track of all of the projects you've been on, and any impact you've had on your organization. Save emails from colleagues that praise and thank you. This is a great way to remind yourself that you're actually better off than you thought! It will boost your confidence in your abilities, and as I mentioned last week, this list will also be helpful when you [ask for a raise or promotion](www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-a-raise/).

## Use your voice

A piece of feedback I've consistently gotten at work is that I don't speak up enough. I know, I know. Those who know me personally are completely shocked by this. (I'm a gabber.) Anyway, it's really easy to sit back quietly in meetings. But one of the easiest ways to feel like you're contributing at work is to actually contribute to conversations.
