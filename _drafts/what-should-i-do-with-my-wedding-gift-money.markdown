Congratulations, you're married! And the wedding planning part of life is finally over! Plus, if you're lucky, you're walking away from your wedding with a nice chunk of change 

## Pay Off Debt

I know this doesn't sound fun. No one likes to pay off debt with gift money. But it's actually hugely important to pay off your debt if you can!

This will help you and your new spouse start your marriage on more solid financial footing.
