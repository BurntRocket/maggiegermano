If you've been paying attention to the news lately, or if you've been looking at your 401k in the past six months, you might be worried about our economy. Newscasters have been warning of an impending recession, the stock market has been dropping... my 401k lost more than $10,000 just over a couple months. It can be scary, especially if you're a millennial that graduated into one of the worst recessions we've ever seen.

## Leave Your Money Alone

## Build Up Your Emergency Fund

If I've learned anything from the recent government shutdown, it's that even gainfully employed Americans are woefully underprepared for emergency situations. Of course, individual employees should not be punished for the inability of our government to operate properly, but that is what happened. Many of the furloughed federal employees were unable to pay their bills or buy groceries after missing two paychecks. 

I'm not beating up on federal employees, because [40% of Americans](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-finances/index.html) would be unable to cover a $400 emergency expense. 

## Talk to Your Boss

In order to maintain your peace of mind, or figure out if you need to find a new job, it's important to know if your job is safe. If a recession is imminent, talk to your boss about the security of your position. 

## Make a Backup Plan
