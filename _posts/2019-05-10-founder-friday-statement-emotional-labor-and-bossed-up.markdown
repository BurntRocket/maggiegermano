I'm back! I was traveling for the last several Fridays, so I took a break from my Founder Friday posts. But I'm back until the end of June! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had our first Airbnb guest in almost a month! I don't know what it was about mid-April to mid-May but our Airbnb was very slow. We had a guest arrive on Wednesday and other one is coming today.

* I'm not sure if this qualifies as earning money, but we received a grant check in the mail today. We found out when getting our fence built that there's a grant program in our town that supports residents improving things on their property like fences or sheds. We applied for the grant and got $1,000 back for what we spent on the fence! Even better, we can apply for that grant every fiscal year, so we will apply for it again when we get a new shed.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Sunday, I took the Amtrak back from New York City and went right downtown to join a birthday brunch for my friend Nina. It was an all you can eat brunch, which I certainly took advantage of.

* After brunch, Dan picked me up from the metro and we bought some groceries for the week.

* All winter and all spring, I complained about not having proper footwear for the weather. I tried ordering these really cute limited edition LL Bean boots, but they would always be sold out when I decided to pull the trigger. After a wet weekend in New York City last weekend, I decided I needed to finally just get some waterproof boots. I bought a cute navy blue pair from Sperry's and I hope they are comfortable!

* Dan and I had an impromptu date night on Tuesday, when he decided to leave work a little bit early. We went to see Captain Marvel at the local Regal theater. We had a $25 gift card from his parents that we didn't think would get us very far. But what would you know! Tickets are only $6 at that theater on Tuesdays! We got two movie tickets and food for about $27, which means we only spent $2 out of pocket. Talk about a budget date! We plan to try to see movies on Tuesdays much more often now.

* We had another slight impromptu date night on Wednesday night while we were taking Bruno out for a walk. There is an outdoor patio at our local market, so we each got a beer and chatted there while Bruno got attention from lots of strangers.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I re-published a [ForbesWomen](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/women-are-working-more-than-ever-but-they-still-take-on-most-household-responsibilities/) piece I wrote for Women's History Month. It's all about how women still take on the bulk of domestic and emotional labor, even though many of us are also working.

## **What I’m Up To**

* The [May Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-improve-your-credit-score-tickets-60438017738) is coming up on Tuesday, May 21st! This month, we'll be talking about how you can improve your credit score. [See you there](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-improve-your-credit-score-tickets-60438017738)?

* On the day after Money Circle, May 22nd, I'll be sponsoring the DC event for the [Bossed Up book tour](https://www.facebook.com/events/407079006790252/)! I've known Emilie for years and she's a huge reason for why I decided to start my own business. I'm excited to read her book and I'm proud to sponsor this event!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I was in New York City last weekend for [Statement](https://www.statementevent.co/). It was the second annual gathering of women in money, where we learn from each other and get advice on our businesses. It was fantastic and I met so many great women! It wasn't like other conferences that are huge and make you feel lost in the shuffle. It was well thought out, impactful, and so worthwhile. I can't wait until next year!

* This is my first weekend in almost a month that I haven't been traveling for something! I'm excited to both relax *and* get some stuff done around the house.

## **What I’m Reading**

I just finished reading *[The Hate U Give](https://www.amazon.com/Hate-U-Give-Angie-Thomas/dp/0062498533)* by Angie Thomas earlier this week and boy, that was a heavy book. It was very good, though, so I recommend it! I've moved on to a much lighter book, which is *[A Princess in Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Princess-Theory-Reluctant-Royals/dp/0062685546)* by Alyssa Cole. I keep falling asleep at night before I can dig too far into it, but I hope to make a dent this weekend.
