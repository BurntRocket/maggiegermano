## **What I’m Writing**

I revisited an old blog post about self care and expanded on what [self care looks like](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-practice-actual-self-care-on-a-budget/) on a budget.

## What I'm Saying

This week, on the [Money Circle podcast](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/my-biggest-money-mistake/), I answered a listener question about my biggest money mistake thus far.

## **What I’m Up To**

* Yesterday, I traveled to Boston to speak at Boston College for an event with [Funding Our Future](https://fundingourfuture.us/) and the [Center for Retirement Research](https://crr.bc.edu/). It was a fun opportunity to talk to students about student loans, saving for the future, and getting their money right.

* I just published the [October Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-preparing-for-holiday-spending-tickets-72080062407)! We’ll be gathering to discuss how to prepare for holiday spending weeks or even months in advance.
