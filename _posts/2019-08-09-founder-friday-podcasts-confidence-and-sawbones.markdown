Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my new clients paid for their first monthly fee.

* We've had three different Airbnb guests this week and into the weekend.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* We spent a lot of money over the weekend having fun with Dan's sister and childhood friend. So we've been reigning it in this week in order to stay within budget for the rest of the month. We bought groceries for the week on Sunday and I bought a refill of our [Branch Basics](http://branchbasics.refr.cc/marygermano) non-toxic cleaning supplies.

* The credit card on our EZpass account expired and we forgot to update it before our trip to and from New York City in early July. We are still paying for that sin by receiving toll bills in the mail over... and over... and over. So we've paid a couple tolls and replenished our EZpass account. Don't forget to keep your EZpass information up to date, especially when you get a new car or a new credit card!

* I bought a copy of Kristen Meinzer's book *[So You Want to Start a Podcast](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062936677/so-you-want-to-start-a-podcast/)* to get her advice while I'm getting started with mine! (PS: Listen to her podcast [By the Book](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/stitcher/by-the-book).)

* We're going to Maine in two weeks to celebrate my birthday (yay!). We adjusted our trip so that we're staying in Portland for two nights and then Bar Harbor for two nights. We booked our Bar Harbor hotel yesterday and altered our Portland Airbnb.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about how you can [improve](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-financial-confidence/) your financial confidence.

## **What I’m Up To**

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-dealing-with-money-shame-tickets-66476917249) meetup is scheduled and ready for you! In August, we’ll be talking about money shame, how others feel the same way, and how to improve our relationship with our money. [See you there!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-dealing-with-money-shame-tickets-66476917249)

* I'm officially launching the Money Circle podcast this month! In fact, I'm having a [launch party in DC on Tuesday, August 20th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-podcast-launch-party-tickets-68050955239). Plus, my birthday is on the 21st, so I'll be celebrating that too. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit any and all money questions that you want me to answer on the podcast!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I'm excited for my podcast launch!

* I'm excited to possibly finally go to Assateague Island this weekend.

* I'm excited for my birthday trip to Maine in two weeks. 

## **What I’m Reading**

I finished Lori Gottlieb's book on Sunday and started the [Sawbones book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/38749668) on Monday night. I love the Sawbones podcast, so I've been enjoying the book so far.
