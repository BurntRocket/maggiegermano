Happy Women's History Month! This is the one month out of the year that is dedicated to celebrating the contributions and achievements of women in America. Like with Black History Month, we should be celebrating women every day. But unfortunately, that's not the case (yet), so it's nice to take advantage of this month to elevate women and the issues affecting them.

Sexual harassment and abuse have been prominent in the news lately, thanks to the #MeToo movement.

## Mental Health Repercussions

## Changing Industries
