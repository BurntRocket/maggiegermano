I'm on my honeymoon right now! Well, I'm actually in the air or in an airport somewhere. We left DC late last night and are en route to Thailand for a three-week honeymoon adventure! You can keep track of what we're up to by following my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/maggiegermano/).

## Save, Save, Save

I know you're probably saving everything you have right now in order to pay for your wedding. However, it's important to remember that you'll want to save up for your honeymoon too!

## Take Advantage of Rewards Programs

## Keep Track of Deals

## Go Somewhere Close

Yes, we're en route to Thailand, but you don't have to travel to the other side of the world for your honeymoon. My parents went to Disney World for their honeymoon. Of course, this was in the 1980s when Disney World was a lot cheaper, but even now it would likely be a lot cheaper than Thailand. So if you're not all that interested in traveling to a faraway land, you can pick a place that's closer, easier to get to, and much more affordable. 

## Delay

More and more of my friends are delaying their honeymoon for six months or a year. That's a great way to recoup some of the money you spent on your wedding and give you time to save up for your honeymoon.
