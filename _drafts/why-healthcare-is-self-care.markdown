I hear about self-care everywhere I look these days. And it's a good thing, we all need to take better care of ourselves. There's always so much information coming at us, and busyness is an epidemic. We don't make a lot of time to actually slow down and take care of ourselves. So

However, it's important to remember that investing in healthcare IS self care. Here are all the things you have access to if you have health insurance and take advantage of it. 

## Annual Physicals

Preventative medicine is so, so important for long term health. 

## Women's Health

## Mental Health Services

## Access to Medication

## Sick Visits

How many people do you know who never go to the doctor, even when they're sick? Are you one of those people?
