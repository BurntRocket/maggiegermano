Recently, there have been [several](https://www.gq.com/story/suze-orman-personal-finance?fbclid=IwAR05723xbP5C46rs-WMK_1KpQvJjT-WpWYWtFwz6uSqmpW6qRyIfYGsE-Yo) [different](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ev3dde/most-money-advice-is-worthless) [articles](https://www.fastcompany.com/90343899/sallie-krawcheck-saving-money-latte-advice) written that criticize the personal finance industry. And for good reason! A lot of the traditional and prevailing financial advice is steeped in privilege and often glosses over the systemic problems that keep people in poverty.

As a financial coach myself, I'm obviously biased in thinking that personal finance advice is important and helpful. I know that most Americans are not given the financial literacy that they need to properly manage their money day-to-day and plan for their futures.

A lot of the other folks I know in the personal finance space are doing things the right way, but for those who aren't, here's what I recommend:

## Be Honest About Your Own Privilege

I don't think privilege is inherently bad. You aren't automatically a bad person if you were born into wealth or other privileged circumstances. The important thing is how you use your privilege for good. It's also imperative that you

## Don't Oversimplify

I'm not a fan of one-size-fits-all financial advice, because everyone is different.

## Don't Tell People To Give Up Joy

One of the easiest ways to make people tune out is to tell them to sacrifice everything that they love. 

# Take Intersectionality Into Account

Every individual's financial situation is going to be at least somewhat dependent upon the intersectionality of their gender, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, etc. The American Constitution might say that all men are created equal, but we are certainly not all treated that way. If you are white, straight, male, educated, and/or upper class, your circumstances are going to be MUCH different than someone who is a person of color

## Don't Promise The World

Recently, Suze Orman said that buying coffee everyday is like throwing millions of dollars down the drain. I think that's the type of outrageous comment that turns a lot of young people off of financial advice.

## Fight For Systemic Change

Like it or not, individual choices and actions are not going to change the system as a whole. Of course, our behaviors can change our own lives to an extent and encourage our loved ones to do the same, but we will still be affected by systemic problems. In order to make real, lasting change in our country's quality of life, we need to change our systems. As a financial coach, and as a human, I speak out for the necessary changes that must take place. I encourage others to do the same. Just a few examples of the changes that need to be made are:

* Universal health care.

* Paid family leave.

* Universal child care.

* A living wage.

*
