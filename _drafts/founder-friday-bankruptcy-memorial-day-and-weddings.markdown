Happy Friday, y’all! I hope you're getting ready for a nice, long weekend. Here’s what I was up to this week.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about [bankruptcy](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-does-bankruptcy-mean-and-should-you-file-for-it/) on my blog. I talked about what it involves, when you might want to consider it, and what the consequences can be.

## **What I’m Up To**

* The [June Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-visualizing-your-money-goals-tickets-62153044429) is up and available for registration! At this event, we'll be visualizing our money goals so that they're more motivating and easier to track. See you there?

* I've been hinting at starting a podcast for a while now. But in order to make sure the podcast is interesting and helpful for YOU, I want to make sure I'm answering your questions. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit any and all money questions that you have! 

## **What I’m Excited About**

* I'm excited for a long weekend! I've been traveling or doing home improvements over the last month or so of weekends, so I'm looking forward to Memorial Day weekend. Dan and I are going to go on a long bike ride on Friday and then will relax in the evening. On Saturday, we're going to visit a couple friends down in Virginia Beach. We haven't seen them in a while, so it'll be great. Plus, beach time!

* Something we've been really looking forward to is the opening of the new [Denizen's](https://denizensbrewingco.com/) brewery location in Riverdale Park. It's finally opening tomorrow, May 25th and we can't wait to check it out on Monday!

## **What I’m Reading**

I'm still working my way through the cute romance novel *[99 Percent Mine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36300625-99-percent-mine)* by Sally Thorne. I've pretty much abandoned *[A Princess in Theory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35271238-a-princess-in-theory)* by Alyssa Cole but I picked up *[Ghosts in the Schoolyard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38923643-ghosts-in-the-schoolyard)* by Eve L. Ewing. It was this month's book for my book club, but I hadn't been able to get to it in time. I've picked it up now and it's very fascinating and sad. I recommend it if you're interested in learning more about Chicago, racism, and school closings.

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**
