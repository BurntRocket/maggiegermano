You know how it is. Holiday season sneaks up on you and you suddenly have to buy a bunch of gifts. You have to travel home to see family. And all the while, you're not quite sure how you're going to afford it all. And you're not alone; the average American racks up $1,000 in debt over the holidays. But what if there was a way to avoid the stress and debt that comes along with holiday spending? It turns out, there is!

Years ago, when I was finally making enough money to feel comfortable buying nice gifts for my friends and family, I went a little hog wild and spent hundreds of dollars. I was excited to treat my loved ones for the first time, but then I looked at my budget and was much less emphatic. I had completely blown my discretionary spending for the month. So I then had to recuperate the money by basically becoming a hermit until the new year. I decided I didn't want to feel that way every year, and I came up with some solutions for myself. And now you can use them too!

## Plan Out Your Travel Spending Early

Flights

Hotels

## Look Back at Last Year's Spending

If you’re going to make any changes, you need to know where you’re starting from. Go through your bank statements from last year and add up what you spent. This should include gifts and any travel expenses that you had to incur. Are you happy with this amount? Do you want it to be higher and lower?

## Get Clear on Your Priorities

Is it more important to you to get home for the holidays or to send gifts? If you have to travel home for the holidays, you may not have much money leftover for the actual gifting part. And that’s okay! Get clear on your priorities at the holidays and set a budget accordingly.

## Make a List of Those You Want to Buy Gifts For

You don’t have to buy a gift for everyone you know. If you can’t afford to buy gifts for everyone who is important to you, you have to prioritize. So, who are the people you absolutely want to buy gifts for this year? You can make a tier 1 (must gift) and tier 2 (maybe gift) list, based on what your budget will end up being.\

If you have a really big family, it may be completely unreasonable to get a gift for every single person. A great solution is this: throw everyone’s name into a hat and have each person pull a name out. That is the person they have to buy a gift for that year. It seriously cuts down on spending and takes a lot of the pressure off.

## Save All Year Long

Create a savings account that is just for holiday spending and gifts throughout the year. That way, you’ll always have money set aside for it. Figure out how much you want to spend each year and divide that amount by 12. That is how much you need to save each month in order to have enough to cover your spending. Make sure that you automate it so that you don’t have to think about moving the money yourself. Set it up through your paycheck direct deposit, ask your bank to move the money, or use an app like Digit.
