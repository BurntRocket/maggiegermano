  #money questions without judgment! '

As a financial blogger, a lot of my writing and advice is fairly general. It's hard to give broad advice that can apply to individuals because there's no one-size-fits-all solution to personal finance. When I'm working with my clients one-on-one, I can give more specific advice, because I know them and I know their situation. However, I know that not everyone can afford (or wants to) work with me one-on-one, but I would still like to help people who have questions or conundrums. I get a lot of questions from family, friends, and clients that I think other people are probably wondering about as well. So I decided to start an advice column where I can answer individualized questions that others may have.

I'll be accepting your questions via email, direct message, or in the comments below. There's no such things as a stupid question, so ask away!

*Dear Maggie,*

*I have recently received a small raise (approx. 4%). And a best practice I've been taught is that you never touch your raises, instead, you put it towards a savings (401K, personal savings account, investing, supporting my mother, etc).*

*My question is: how can I make the best decision of where this additional income should go? I have a few ideas (like the ones listed above) but I'm not sure where to begin so I'm stuck and haven't made any moves.*

*Is there a general formula I should follow? (i.e. a certain percentage of your disposable income should go towards savings, another towards 401K, investments?) Any advice will help - thank you!*

*THANK YOU!

Dear A Girl Looking for Financial Freedom,

Congratulations on your raise! 4% might not feel like much, but every bit help in your journey to financial freedom. And you're absolutely on the right path since you want to put that raise towards your financial goals, rather than spending it. 

My first question would be: how much are you contributing to your retirement savings now? You should at least be contributing up to the amount that your employer matches, if they offer a match. Beyond that, it's important to increase your retirement contribution every time you get a raise. 

Good luck and congratulations again!

Best,\
Maggie
