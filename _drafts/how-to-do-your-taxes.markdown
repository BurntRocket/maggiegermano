It's the most wonderful time of the year! Just kidding, it's tax season. If you're traditionally employed, you should have received your W-2 by now, which means you have most of what you need to file your taxes.

## Give Yourself Plenty of Time

Tax Day is April 15th, which means it's the last day you can file your taxes without them being late. April may seem like it's really far away, but time has a way of speeding up when you're avoiding something. Before you know it, it's 10pm on Tax Day and you're furiously trying to finish filing your taxes. Don't let that be you! Start early so that you have time to finish things without stress. You never know what might come up, or if you're missing documents you need. Start gathering your needed information now and set a deadline that is sooner than April 15th. 

## Gather All Your Paperwork

Like I mentioned above, you should have received your W-2 by January 31st.
