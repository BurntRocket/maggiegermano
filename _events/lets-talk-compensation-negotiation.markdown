Are you in the midst of a job search? Perhaps you've never felt comfortable while negotiating your compensation. This month, we'll be joined by Anna Halbrooks, an experienced recruiting professional. She's ready and excited to answer any questions you have about negotiation. Don't leave money on the table anymore!

Money Circle is a safe open space where women can ask questions, air their fears, brag about accomplishments, and be honest about any confusion they may have around money.

Light snacks and wine will be provided.
