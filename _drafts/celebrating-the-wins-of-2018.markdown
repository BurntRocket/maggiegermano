It's almost the end of 2018! I honestly can't believe how quickly the year flew by. Something I've been doing for the past couple of years is stopping to reflect on the past year so that I can celebrate my wins, big and small. It's important to acknowledge and celebrate our accomplishments, so that we don't forget about them. It's easy to focus on what we didn't achieve (and the New Years Resolutions we abandoned), but it's a little harder to call out what we *did* do. Taking the time to reflect like this might surprise you. You may have achieved more than you thought you did. Give yourself this chance to be proud of yourself so you're motivated to set new goals for 2019.

How can you do that?

## Make a Long List

Sit down and make a list of everything you accomplished this year. It can be as big as running a marathon and as small as getting your annual physical. Anything that made you happy and moved you forward in life is considered a win. You might have to wrack your brain a little, 

## Treat Yourself

Allow yourself to treat yourself for everything you accomplished in 2018. It can be something very small, but do something nice for yourself. I think the "treat yourself" 

## Set Goals for 2019

## My 2018 Wins:

* **I Took My Business Full-Time**

On January 1, 2018, I was officially a full-time business owner, having left my day job at the end of December. It was a terrifying leap, but one that I felt that I had to take. There have certainly been ups and downs throughout the year, but I don't regret the move. I've learned a lot about myself and my business, and I know that big changes are coming in 2019, too.

* **I Got ICF Certified**

Last year, I received my first coaching certification through [CoachDiversity Institute](https://coachdiversity.com/). This year, I took the next step of getting certified by the [International Coach Federation](https://coachfederation.org/), as they are viewed as the authority on coaching certification. I am now both a Certified Professional Diversity Coach and an Associate Certified Coach.

* **I Ran an Airbnb Rental**

When Dan and I were looking to buy a house last year, one of my big priorities was to find a house with a basement that we could rent out. I knew we could afford our mortgage ourselves, but I also wanted to have a potential extra income source. We got lucky and found a house with a finished basement and its own entrance. Since we finished fixing it up in February, we've been running it as an Airbnb rental. It's actually been really successful! We get guests from all over the world, either to visit the University of Maryland or DC. Next year, our county will be implementing some limitations to how often we can rent out the space during the year, but I'm still optimistic about the extra income it will bring.

* **I Had My First Big Paid Speaking Gig**

In June, I spoke on a financial literacy panel at the [NCCWSL](https://www.nccwsl.org/) at University of Maryland. It just so happened that the director of the Women's Leadership & Mentorship Program at Robert Morris University was in the audience. She liked what I had to say, so she brought me to Pittsburgh to speak at her program's orientation. It was my first well-paid

* **My Business Won An Award**

I won the Women Empowerment Entrepreneur of the Year Award from the DC Women's Business Center this year!

* **I Hired a Financial Planner**

I may be a financial coach, but I'm not a certified financial planner, so I wanted to get a little extra help managing my money. Especially after this year, when I took a pay cut by quitting my job, I wanted to make sure Dan and I were staying on the right track financially. We hired my friend, Jessie Hill, to advise us on our retirement savings, and also to buy life insurance. You're better off locking in life insurance when you're young and healthy, so we wanted to get on top of that now.

* **I Got Married**

You may have noticed, based on my wedding-heavy content, that I got married this year! As you also may have noticed, I didn't love the planning process, so I'm glad to finally be married. The wedding itself was beautiful and it was wonderful to have most of the people we love all in one place.

* **I Went to Thailand**

Before my honeymoon, I had never actually traveled to Asia. I'd heard wonderful things about Thailand for years and always wanted to make the trip. Dan and I decided to take the leap and go to Thailand for nearly 3 weeks for our honeymoon. It was an amazing experience that was unlike any other vacation I've taken. It forced me to get out of my comfort zone in many ways, whether it was the language, the food, or the transportation. I got to hang out with elephants
