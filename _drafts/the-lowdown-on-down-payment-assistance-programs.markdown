You did it! You found the house! It’s a 3 bed, 2.5 bath with gorgeous master bedroom, open concept kitchen, shiplap walls, and Spanish tiles in the entryway. It’s like JoJo from Fixer Upper designed it herself. And it was only $100,000! Okay, let’s get real, folks. Buying in Washington, DC often takes a sizable chunk of your change. Even after you’ve scrimped and saved it can be hard to pour every penny you have into the down payment, the closing costs, and the moving fees. In fact, no reputable agent or lender would advise that you do that; that’s where the term “house poor” comes from.

Fortunately, you’re not alone; there are programs out there from the federal government, the DC government, and from private lenders that help cover some or all of these fees. (No, movers won’t be covered – but if you’re moving in from out of state or from abroad, there’s a good chance your employer will help if asked!) Let’s get familiar with these costs:

## What’s a Down Payment?

This is the amount of money you “put down” to spend at the start of the purchase that is part of your home loan. It’s typically 3-25% of the total loan; so, on a $400,000 condo, your down payment could be anywhere from $12,000 - $100,000. That’s quite a spread; put that on your bread and butter it! Most people in DC will put down 10-20% but as a buyer, it’s good to know you can put down less.

Lenders prefer you put down more because they think it means you’re less likely to default on your mortgage (that’s industry term for not paying your mortgage and it’s a really bad idea, I wouldn’t suggest it).  Your credit score, history, total debt, and annual income all impact the loan amount you can qualify for. See my post [last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/financing-options-when-its-time-to-buy/) on how a lender pre-approves your loan.
