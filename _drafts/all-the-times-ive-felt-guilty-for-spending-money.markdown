## Travel

The funny thing about this guilt is it wasn't about the actual money I was spending. In fact, for years, I've prioritized saving for travel so that I can explore this world without guilt and without going into debt. I believe that if you love to travel, spending money (that you have) on it should never be a shameful thing. It only improves your quality of life.

The guilt I have felt has actually come after I've spoken to friends and family about my travel plans.

## My Wedding

As a feminist and a financial coach, I'm very aware of how capitalism and the wedding industrial complex pressures people to overspend on their weddings. So I felt very strongly about not spending a lot on my wedding. When I received a settlement from a shoulder injury, I set aside $10,000 earmarked for my eventual wedding (we weren't even engaged yet - can you tell I like to plan ahead?). I was certain that $10,000 would be plenty for a wedding. Boy, was I wrong. In fact, we're paying more than double that amount for our wedding. And we're only having 130 people attend! And we are getting married an hour away from DC. And we pursued a lot of cost-cutting measures! The point is: weddings are incredibly expensive. We really wanted a wedding where we could invite almost everyone we love the most. Put those two things together and you have to spend quite a bit of money. Luckily, we have been able to save up the amount in full, and will not be going into debt for the wedding. In fact, we may have some money leftover afterwards, because we saved an extra 10% as a buffer.

But having enough to spend on our wedding didn't take away the intense shame and inner conflict I felt throughout the planning process. I felt strongly, on principle, that we should spend as little as possible. But at the same time, there were many things I was not willing to DIY in order to save money. I also wasn't willing to have a tiny, inexpensive wedding that many of our loved ones wouldn't be able to attend. I had many values that were in direct conflict with each other.

Here are the areas where we spent more than I wanted to, but will actually turn out great:

* **Our photographer.** She's amazing and we have great chemistry with her. It took some convincing, but now I realize that spending a lot on photography will be worth it.

* **Our florist.** Do you know how many times I said "we don't even need centerpieces!"? I said it a lot. We're spending more than double what I wanted to spend on flowers. But I didn't want to be up late the night before my wedding finishing up the centerpieces. So we hired a florist who is associated with our venue and who grows many of their own flowers. They value sustainability and authenticity. They seemed to really vibe with our wedding day vision, and I think the flowers will turn out beautifully. Plus, we definitely cut some costs here, as the bridesmaids will not carry bouquets.

* **Our venue.** When we first booked our venue, I felt really good about the price. This was because I was completely naive about everything else we needed to pay for. I also wasn't fully aware that almost nothing came with the venue fee. We had to rent a bathroom trailer, tables, chairs, and we had to pay for all of the staff from a different vendor.

Here are the areas where we saved some money and feel really good about it:

* **DJ.** We're actually not hiring a DJ. We are making our own playlists and we hired an audio engineer who will run the sound system for the day.

* **Booze.** We had to overspend a bit on wine because we were required to purchase wine from the venue (they're a vineyard), and their wine is more expensive than the three-buck chuck I would have gotten from Trader Joe's. But we're making up for this by buying our own cases of beer. We're going to try to only buy local beer, but this will still be more affordable than having our vendor provide the booze.

* **Wedding dress and shoes.** I've written about this before, but my wedding dress cost less than $250. (Plus, my mom paid for it.) I don't often spend a lot on my clothes, so I felt strongly about not spending a lot on my wedding dress. I also really wanted something very simple that I felt like myself in. I found the perfect dress from BHLDN and it was even cheaper than I expected! To top it off, Dan and I both bought our wedding shoes from Poshmark.

Here are the areas where we spent more than I wanted to, and am still annoyed about it:
