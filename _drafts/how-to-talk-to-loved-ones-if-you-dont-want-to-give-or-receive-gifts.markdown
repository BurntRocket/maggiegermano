Last week, I saw a series of Instagram stories from [Melissa Hartwig](https://www.instagram.com/melissa_hartwig/), co-founder of [Whole 30](https://whole30.com/). Melissa shared her annual [gift guide](https://whole30.com/2018/11/gift-guide/), and went into detail about how and why does doesn't give or receive gifts during the holidays. She decided over a decade ago that the gift-giving insanity of the holiday season wasn't serving her anymore. As you might imagine, her family wasn't super on board at first. Melissa shared advice based on how she had these conversations with her family. I shared some of her advice on my Instagram and got excited responses from people who want to incorporate the "no gifts" rule in their lives. This transition can be tough, so I thought I'd write a post about how to talk to your loved ones about it.
