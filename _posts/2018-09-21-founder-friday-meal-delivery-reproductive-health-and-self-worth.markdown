Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* I hosted my first-ever budgeting workshop last Saturday at [Yoga Heights](https://yogaheightsdc.com/). Eventbrite processed the transfer of the payment this week.

* Two of my ongoing clients paid their monthly fees this week.

* I did a virtual presentation for a group at a wealth management company in Florida on Monday. They sent the check in the mail this week.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* I'm trying out a new meal delivery service. Dan and I have been terrible about eating well ever since we moved into our house almost a year ago. With our wedding staring us down, we want to get serious about eating healthy so we can feel our best on our wedding day and beyond. I put in an order for [Sun Basket](http://www.sunbasket.com), using the "lean and clean" option. I'm excited to see how it goes. If you want to get $40 off your first order, [use my link](https://sunbasket.com/invite/Mary1915063)!

* One of the activities that Dan really wants to do on our honeymoon is taking a cooking class! Since his birthday is happening while we're in Thailand, I picked a cooking class for that day. Since that week is also a festival week in Chiang Mai, I had to pay this week to hold our spots.

* I had two doctor's appointments this week, so I paid two co-pays.

* The [Hungry Harvest fee](http://hharvest.net/m5didTk) was charged for our produce delivery last Friday.

* On Thursday, I was in the city for a few meetings and a book reading, so I bought myself a few cups of green tea throughout the day.

* We bought two stamps and ink pads for our wedding, so that we can stamp gift bags and other things with our wedding mark. We also bought some wedding-themed stickers to keep my niece and nephew entertained during the busy day.

## What I’m Writing

* In honor of Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, I wrote a piece about why you should [separate your self worth from your net worth](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/why-its-important-to-separate-your-self-worth-from-your-money/).

* I wrote an extra post this week about how you can [start protecting your reproductive health](www.maggiegermano.com/blog/its-time-to-prepare-to-protect-your-reproductive-health/), in case the Supreme Court ends up having a majority of anti-choice justices.

## What I’m Up To

* Next month, [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) is meeting to talk about [how to ask for a raise](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-ask-for-a-raise/) at your current job. If you know you'll have to do this soon, join us on October 24th!

* Soooooo... we had to cancel this week's Money Circle meetup because the host had an issue arise. But fear not, we'll still talk about how to plan ahead for holiday spending! We're rescheduling for December, so you can be super informed and ready for next year! Plus, you can already [sign up](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-plan-for-holiday-spending-tickets-50456857820)!

## What I’m Excited About

* I'm excited for [FinCon](https://finconexpo.com/), which is coming up next week! It's a huge conference for financial bloggers and other financial professionals. This will be my third time attending, and I'm really looking forward to it. *Will you be there? Send me a note so we can meet up!*

* I met [Erin Gibson](http://www.gibblertron.com/) last night! You probably know her if you listen to the hilarious podcast [Throwing Shade](http://www.throwingshade.com/). She recently wrote a book, called *[Feminasty](https://www.feminasty.com/)*, and I went to her book reading at [Kramerbooks](http://kramers.com/). I loved her book so much, so you should definitely read it!
