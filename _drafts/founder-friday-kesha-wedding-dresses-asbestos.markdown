TGIF! Is anyone else dancing into the weekend? This weekend won't be very relaxing for me, but I'm looking forward to it nonetheless. If you haven't seen my first #FounderFriday post yet, check it out! 

## How I Earned Money This Week

* I have two new clients starting in February!

# How I Spent Money This Week

* I went out to lunch with two friends on Monday. I spent $9 on tacos at District Taco. Yum.

* Homeownership is something. Somedays it feels like an actual money pit. I love our house but... it's expensive. This week, I spent $275 to get the vermiculite insulation in our attic tested for asbestos. Hurray! Luckily, I still had money set aside for this type of expense, so I didn't have to take a hit financially. **Pot twist:** the substance wasn't even vermiculite and contained no asbestos. So all is well, even though the testing expense was kind of a waste.

* We had quite a bit of groceries left over from last week, so we only spent about $20 on groceries this week. Plus, we made a beef stew that lasted us most of the week!

* The $150 that I had on my Smartrip card mysteriously disappeared yesterday, so I had to add some money to the card. To make things worse, WMATA no longer allows a [negative balance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/11/24/amid-fare-crackdown-metro-to-do-away-with-negative-balances-on-smartrip-cards/) on your card, so I had to add money to even be allowed out of the station. I'm really hoping to get that money back, as I was relying on it to carry me through the next few months.

## What I'm Writing

This week, I wrote about why I decided to quit my very stable day job and become a full-time entrepreneur. [Read it here](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/why-i-quit-my-day-job/)!

## What I'm Excited About

* My grandma is taking our whole family to the Dominican Republic this summer! We're getting close to booking the stay and it's lovely to have warmth and sun to look forward to while it's still frigid outside.

* I found my wedding dress! For some reason, I was really stressed about finding an affordable wedding dress that I liked. I went dress shopping back in December with my mom, sisters, bridesmaids, and niece and didn't have much luck. But this week, I went to [BHLDN](https://www.bhldn.com/) with my friend Liz and fell in love with the second dress I put on. The icing on the cake? It only costs $240! For context, that average bride spends [$1,500](https://www.theknot.com/content/average-cost-of-wedding-dress-2016) on her wedding dress. I knew I did not want to spend that much, so I'm thrilled that I found a super affordable dress that I love!

* I was (briefly) quoted in [CNN Monday](http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/01/pf/new-career-budget-lower-paycheck/index.html) this week! I talked about how to prepare if you're going to take a pay cut for a career change.

## What I'm Fan-Girling Over

* Kesha's performance of "Praying" at the Grammy's. I'm less keen on [Sony's tweet](https://www.spin.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-kesha-dr-luke-sony-music-tweet/) about the performance, considering they counter-sued her to keep her tethered to her abuser, Dr. Luke.

* I started watching Crazy Ex-Girlfriend earlier this month and I'm still obsessed. The whole series is on Netflix, so dig in! If you've already watched it, try out all four seasons of Grace and Frankie instead.

* I started reading [Nasty Women](https://www.amazon.com/Nasty-Women-Feminism-Resistance-Revolution/dp/1250155509), a compilation of essays by awesome women like Samantha Irby, Jessica Valenti, and Cheryl Strayed. It's both infuriating and wonderful.

## Money Tips to Take Into the Weekend

* Invite a friend (or two) over for a home cooked meal instead of going out to a restaurant. It will save you money AND you can bring your own wine.

* Start gathering your tax documents together so you don't put off filing for too long.

* Look at your calendar for next week. Based on your plans, how much money do you think you'll spend? Let that inform how much you spend this weekend. 

Happy Friday!
