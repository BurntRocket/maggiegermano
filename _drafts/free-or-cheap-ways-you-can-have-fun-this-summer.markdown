As I wrote last week, it's important to plan ahead all year in order to have fun during the summer. That's true of any time you'll be spending more money than usual. But it's also true that you can find ways to have fun that don't cost much or any money at all. The key is to get creative and do some extra research. Going out to eat or drink is not the only way to have fun and be social. Here are just a few inexpensive ideas that I have enjoyed myself.

## Public Pool

In many places, if you're a resident of the city, you can visit public pools for free. In DC, you just have to show your DC ID or a recent utility statement. When I lived in DC proper, I loved going to the public pool on summer weekends. When I lived in Eckington, my local pool was XX. The best part was that the area hadn't gotten super popular yet, so that pool was rarely crowded. When I lived over near U Street, my local pool was near Howard University. That pool was VERY crowded. The key was to get there before it opened and get in line so that you could actually get a chair by the pool. Going to the pool is a great way to stay local and still get some pool time. To make it even more fun, invite your friends! But make sure to put on sunscreen.

## Museum

We are spoiled by free museums in Washington, DC. I'm still not used to paying to get into museums when I travel to other cities. But regardless, museums are a great way to stay entertained all day without having to spend too much money.

Even if the museum is free, an easy way to blow your budget is by getting a meal inside the museum. The cafes can be very pricey (and not always very high quality), so plan to either bring a sandwich and some snacks, or get lunch afterwards.
