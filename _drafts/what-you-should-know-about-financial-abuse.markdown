You've heard of physical abuse. You've heard of emotional abuse. You've heard of sexual abuse. But have you heard of financial abuse? Probably not. It's just one more way that abusers wield their power to disenfranchise their victims. Financial abuse is when money is used as a weapon. That can mean withholding money, stealing money, restricting the use of money, accruing debt in a partner's name without their knowledge, or sabotaging a partner's career. These behaviors make a victim dependent upon their abuser and make it difficult for them to leave the relationship. Because of this, financial abuse is more common and more insidious than you might think.

## Many Women Have Experienced Domestic Abuse

According to the [Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2016/07/understanding-intimate-partner-violence-sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights-issue?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5N2Plbfz4AIVxV6GCh0EgQMQEAAYAyAAEgLGTvD_BwE), nearly half of all women in the United States have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner, a quarter of women have experiences physical violence, and almost 10 percent have been raped by an intimate partner. To make matters worse, one-third of women who are murdered in the United States are killed by a current or former male partner. These are sobering numbers. They show that a huge swath of our population has experienced domestic violence of some kind, and domestic violence often escalates to murder.

## Most Abuse Victims Have Experienced Financial Abuse

So now we know that up to 50 percent of all women in the United States experience domestic abuse of some kind. But what does that have to do with financial abuse? Financial abuse actually occurs in up to 99 percent of all abusive relationships.

## It's Not About the Money

Financial abuse isn't actually about money, it's about control.

## It Can Ruin Careers

According to the [National Coalition Against Domestic Violence](https://ncadv.org/blog/posts/quick-guide-economic-and-financial-abuse) (NCADV), between 21 and 60 percent of victims of intimate partner violence lose their jobs due to reasons stemming from the abuse.
