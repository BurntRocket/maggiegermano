Hey there! I'm trying something new this week, so let me know what you think in the comments. I want to write to you more than once a week, and I want you to get to know me better. So, inspired by my friend Emilie Aries of [Bossed Up](http://bossedup.org), I'm starting my own Founder Friday post. 

## How I Earned Money This Week

I think it's important to be transparent about money, especially as a new business owner. Just because I'm getting a lot of exposure on the internet doesn't mean that I'm earning as much money as I'd like to be earning. But I am earning some money; more than I was expecting for my first month as a full-time entrepreneur! Most of my clients pay monthly, so I'm not earning most of my money week by week, but I did have some other income this week.

* On Monday, I babysat a 2-year-old using the babysitting app Chime. I made $67 after fees for 5 hours of babysitting, with about 90 minutes commuting round-trip. I probably won't do this again.

* I got a new one-time session client for next week. One-time coaching sessions cost $200, which I earn, minus Stripe fees.
