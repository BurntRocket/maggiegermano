Happy Friday! I hope you're staying dry on this misty day. Here's what I've been up to this week!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* The fees from the February Money Circle deposited into my account this week.

* One of my monthly coaching clients paid for March early.

* We had three Airbnb guests over the past week, and their fees are depositing into our bank account soon.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* I tried really hard not to spend money this week. I'm sure you understand how the last few days of the month can be tight. If I get close to my budget limit, I try not to spend money again until the 1st of the next month. However, I did spend a few dollars on tea at a coffee shop, and about $15 at Home Depot (of course).

## What I'm Writing

Financial tasks, like filing your taxes, can be incredibly stressful. It's easy to avoid doing the things that stress us out the most. So [I wrote this week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-get-to-your-happy-place-before-doing-your-taxes/) about how to get into your happy place before you tackle your taxes. 

## What I'm Excited About
