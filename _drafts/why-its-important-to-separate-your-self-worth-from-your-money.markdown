As a financial coach, I hear from a lot of people who beat themselves up because of their financial situation. They are stressed out about money and they blame themselves. They feel embarrassed, ashamed, isolated, and stupid for the situation they are in. And it's normal to feel that way; it's often easier to be angry at ourselves, rather than figure out what we need to do to make a change. Plus, financial problems are still pretty taboo in our society. But this kind of negative self-talk can be damaging beyond the bank account. It can lead to shame, hopelessness, depression, and even suicide.

This month, which is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, I want to take today talk about why you should separate your self worth from your money.

## Your Net Worth Doesn't Determine Your Self Worth

It might be easy to forget when you're out there reading blogs and scrolling through Instagram, but your net worth does not determine your self worth. Your worthiness as a person does not rely on how much money you have in the bank or how much debt you've paid off. 

Not only will you feel like shit 

## Your Past Mistakes Don't Define You

Just because you've made mistake with your money (or any other part of your life) in the past, doesn't mean you're bad with money. It's important to separate who you are as a person from past behaviors. If you see the possibility that you can make changes for yourself, you'll be more motivated to make them.

## Your Well-Being is More Important Than Your Money

I've seen many people toil away in toxic workplaces, or in bad relationships, because they think it's the more responsible thing to do. Perhaps they would have to take a pay cut if they changed jobs, or they'd have to pay higher rent if they left their relationship. These are understandable worries to have! Money and being able to afford your life is no joke. But constant unhappiness is no joke either.
