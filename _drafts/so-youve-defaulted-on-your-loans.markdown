Defaulting on a loan means that you've missed payments so long that you've broken the payment contract with your lender. This can apply to student loans, personal loans, credit cars, auto loans, mortgages, and more. Basically, any loan you take out can be defaulted on if you stop paying. There are serious, long-lasting consequences to defaulting on your loans, but not all defaults are equal.

## Student Loans

Student loans are one of the worst types of loans to default on.

**Pro-tip:** If you find yourself in a bad financial situation where you are unable to pay your student loans, you don't have to go into default! Call your student loan provider and tell them what's going on. There are ways to either lower your payments or defer your payments until you are able to pay. This is a much better approach than not paying at all.

## Auto Loan

## Personal Loan

## Credit Cards
