## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I have been living without a dining room set. All of our guests have been forced to sit in our office chairs at Dan's desk in the dining room. So we finally bit the bullet and bought a farmhouse-style dining room table, with a bench to go with it. We still need to pick out some chairs to round it out, but they can wait. **Bonus:** we used credit card rewards points to pay for them.

* If you're friends with me on Facebook, you've probably seen me complain that our oven is leaking carbon monoxide. Our energy audit found that it's leaking about triple the amount that is safe. So instead of paying more than half the cost of a new oven on a repair, we bought a brand new oven. Luckily, we still have some savings leftover to cover the cost.

* My favorite yoga pants have finally retired. Each leg has a giant hole in it, so I bought two new pairs from Old Navy.

## What I'm Writing

It's tax season and it's not always necessary to go it alone. Check out my piece about when it might make sense to hire a tax professional. 

## What I'm Excited About

* I was quoted in [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/moonlighting/2018/02/20/how-freelance-full-time/110635826/) about how I prepared to quit my job and be a full-time business owner!
