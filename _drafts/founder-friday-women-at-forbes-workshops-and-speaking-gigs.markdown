Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my monthly clients’ payment went through this week.

* The **[Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/)** payments were transferred from Eventbrite after the event on Tuesday.

* We had two different Airbnb guests throughout the week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Sunday, Dan and I got bagels at **[The Bagel Place](https://www.bagelplacecollegepark.com/)** for breakfast. We rarely go out for food on the weekends, but we wanted to treat ourselves. It was totally worth it.

* On Monday, I got some pretty exciting news about my business (I’ll announce soon!), so Dan and I went to **[Burton’s Grill & Bar](https://burtonsgrill.com/)** in Riverdale Park to celebrate. We hadn’t been to that restaurant yet, so it was nice to finally try it out. It’s a little overpriced for the Maryland suburbs, but the food was good. Dan got the maxx burger with bacon and I got the lobster shrimp pasta.

* I don’t go into DC everyday, but when I do, the Metro fare is more expensive than it was when I lived in the city. So I go through my Metro money pretty quickly. I had to reload my card this week since I went downtown three times!

* My mom’s birthday was this past Wednesday and my dad’s birthday is next Saturday, so I bought two cute cards at **[Cherry Blossom Creative](http://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/)** this week. Yes, I’m behind on buying actual gifts, but this was progress!

* I just recently rolled of the **[Collective Action for Safe Spaces](http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/)** board of directors, but I still support what they do and love the people. So this week, I went to a fundraising happy hour at **[Little Coco’s](http://www.littlecocos.com/)** and bought two beers. If you want to **[donate](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/collectiveactiondc)** to CASS and support their work, I highly recommend it! If you can’t afford to donate, volunteer with them!

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about personal loans and whether or not they are right for you. If you struggle with credit card debt and are looking for a solution, personal loans might be a good option. **[Read the article](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/whats-a-personal-loan-and-when-should-you-get-one/)** and be honest with yourself about whether or not a personal loan might get you into a better financial position.

## **What I’m Up To**

* Speaking of personal loans, I was quoted in **[Student Loan Hero](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/what-is-a-good-interest-rate-for-a-personal-loan/)** talking about your odds and offerings depending on your credit score.

* The **[August Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/)** is planned and available for registration! We’ll be focusing on homebuying for first-timers, and we’ll be joined by the wonderful real estate agent (and dear friend) Liz Delgado-Steo. Liz is great at breaking down the homebuying process into language you can understand, so this is a meetup you can’t miss! **[Register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-homebuying-for-newbies-tickets-48132651055)**!

* I’m planning a budgeting workshop for August or September. It will likely be a 3-hour workshop, where you will learn budgeting basics and then we’ll actually create our budgets! We realized at the budgeting Money Circle gathering that a more in-depth budgeting session was needed, so your wish is my command! Is this something you’ll be interested in? Comment below or email me at **[hello@maggiegermano.com](mailto:hello@maggiegermano.com)** and let me know!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* We had a sold out **[Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/)** gathering this week! It was the first time we’ve sold out, which was super exciting! Y’all are really interested in learning all you can about investing, and **[Claudia Russell](http://msengineeredwealth.com/)** did a great job as our expert! (See you next month at our **[homebuying](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/homebuying-for-newbies/)** Money Circle?)

* I mentioned **[last week](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/founder-friday-beer-curtains-and-biz-development/)** that I joined the **[Signed](https://www.smartgetspaid.com/signed/)** business and sales program with Leah Neaderthal. We had our first module and video call this week, and it was incredibly illuminating.

* I’m obsessed with stand-up comedy lately. I listen to the podcast **[Put Your Hands Together](https://www.earwolf.com/show/put-your-hands-together/)** on a weekly basis. I loved Cameron Esposito’s new special called ***[Rape Jokes](https://www.cameronesposito.com/)***, I laughed and sobbed through Hannah Gadsby’s ***[Nanette](https://www.netflix.com/title/80233611)***, I watch anything that **[Tig Notaro](http://tignation.com/)** does… you get the idea. So imagine my excitement when I saw that Cameron Esposito and her wife, Rhea Butcher, are coming to DC with Tig Notaro for the **[Bentzen Ball](https://brightestyoungthings.com/bentzen-ball)** in October! I bought my tickets first thing this morning and can’t wait to attend. See you there?

* I got my butt back to the gym this week! I was on vacation for the first week of July, and then I was out of commission with more than one sickness for all of last week. I was nervous about going back to my workout class, because I had never taken that much time away from it since getting started. I’m super sore but I’m feeling good about being back at it!

* I’m heading home to Syracuse next weekend for my bridal shower! I was torn about whether or not I wanted a bridal shower, but now I’m really excited to be with my family to celebrate my upcoming marriage. I can’t wait to see what my sisters came up with for the party!

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

![It feels really natural to want to avoid your money problems. But that doesn't make them go away. In fact, it makes them even worse. So open up that bill that's been sitting on your counter. Call the creditor back.

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
