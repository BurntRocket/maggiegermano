I think the number one issue I hear about from clients and readers is not knowing how to budget. Or feeling overwhelmed by what budgeting is supposed to look like. Traditionally, budgeting looks like having an exact amount to spend on all the different categories of life, and never going over in any of them. But in reality, every month looks different than the one before, so you don't always know how much you'll spend on specific things. For example, last month, I spent way more than usual on going out to eat. But I spent a lot less on things like entertainment. So my actual budget was even and I didn't overspend. However, if I looked at it in the way Mint told me, I might be stressed out about overspending on dining.

I switched to one budget number a few years ago when I realized it was getting really onerous to track my spending in the different categories. If I wasn't spending more than was available to me, why did it matter where it was going? Of course, if you feel like you're spending money without having an idea of where it's actually going, it can be helpful to categorize it so that you can be more mindful about your spending.
