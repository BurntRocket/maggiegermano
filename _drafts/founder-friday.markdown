Happy Friday! I think it's finally, actually spring! I'll be spending most of my time inside for the final weekend of the current cohort of [CoachDiversity Institute](http://coachdiversity.com/), but I do plan to take advantage of the warmth during our breaks. Here's what I was up to this week!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* None of my clients' payments went through this week, so all my earnings are from Airbnb!

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Three monthly subscription payments for my business went through this week, and I also spent some money on snacks for [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/), as well as a Lyft home from the event.

* On Sunday, Dan and I drove to Leesburg, Virginia to see our friend and wedding officiant, who was in town for a wedding. We went to [Vanish Farmwood Brewery](https://vanishbeer.com/) for a few hours and had some beer and too much food. 

* On Monday, we went to another brewery, [Atlas Brew Works](http://www.atlasbrewworks.com/), in DC for the Safe Space Jam! If you weren't able to make it to the event, you can still [donate](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/collectiveactiondc) to [Collective Action for Safe Spaces](http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/), if you want to support their efforts to make DC a safer space for all. I was an official sponsor for the event, but we also bought a few extra beers.

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about [debt consolidation](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-are-your-options-for-debt-consolidation/). It can be difficult to pay down debt when you have many different accounts with different interest rates and due dates. In [this article](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/what-are-your-options-for-debt-consolidation/), I give the pros and cons of the different consolidation options. Check it out and let me know what you think!

## What I’m Excited About

## What I’m Up To

* The [May Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-survive-wedding-season-on-a-budget/) event is up! Next month, we'll be talking about how to survive wedding season on a budget. We'll be in Eastern Market for the evening. See you there?
