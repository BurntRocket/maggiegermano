TGIF! Am I the only one who felt like this week too forever? I'm excited to spend this weekend doing yard work and catching up with friends. Here's what I was up to this week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* One of my monthly clients' payments went through on Sunday.

* We have two different guests staying in our Airbnb this week and weekend.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* I spent Tuesday in the city for [Solopreneur Circle](https://www.solopreneurcircle.com/) (yay!). I didn't plan my schedule very well, nor did I pack a lunch, so I ended up buying a small pizza from [Pizzeria Vetri](https://www.pizzeriavetri.com/).

* I'm trying my darnedest to make our first floor bathroom look not terrible. I've been repainting the walls this week, but I also wanted all new matching hardware. So I bought a set of oil-rubbed bronze bathroom accessories. I can't wait to hang them up!

* We finally ordered our save-the-dates for our wedding! I personally wanted to have them mailed out weeks ago, but such is life. The postcards themselves will only cost around $50, but then we spent about $30 on stamps. Not too shabby for a wedding product that can cost much more than that. (I'm afraid to see how much our invitations will cost, though.)

* Soon after we moved into our new house, we bought a king-sized bed and duvet. Now that it's getting warmer out (finally), we need a lighter blanket that is the right size for our bed. So we bought a really cute quilt from [Crane and Canopy](https://www.craneandcanopy.com/products/the-chevron-charcoal-grey-quilt-sham).

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about the [one number budgeting method](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-use-one-budget-number-to-manage-your-money/). This method makes tracking your spending and staying on budget so. much. easier. What do you think? Have you tried this approach?

## What I’m Excited About

* I just got a ticket to see [Roxane Gay](http://www.roxanegay.com/) speak at [Sixth & I on June 13th](https://www.sixthandi.org/event/roxanne-gay/)! This will be the third (or fourth?) time that I've seen Roxane and I still can't miss her. Her newest book, [Not That Bad](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062413505/not-that-bad), will be released on May 1st. Make sure you read the rest of her books: [Hunger](https://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Memoir-Body-Roxane-Gay/dp/0062362593/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1524149616&sr=8-4&keywords=roxane\+gay&dpID=41S4yvewK-L&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch), [Difficult Women](https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Women-Roxane-Gay/dp/0802127371/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1524149616&sr=8-5&keywords=roxane\+gay&dpID=51QJnX0bTsL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch), [Bad Feminist](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Feminist-Essays-Roxane-Gay/dp/0062282719/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1524149616&sr=8-1&keywords=roxane\+gay&dpID=41wmScO2UaL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch), [An Untamed State](https://www.amazon.com/Untamed-State-Roxane-Gay/dp/0802122515/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1524149616&sr=8-6&keywords=roxane\+gay&dpID=51C0Y8b0DtL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch), [Ayiti](https://www.amazon.com/Ayiti-Roxane-Gay/dp/145077671X/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1524149616&sr=8-8&keywords=roxane\+gay), and [Black Panther: World of Wakanda](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Panther-Wakanda-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/130290650X/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1524149616&sr=8-7&keywords=roxane\+gay).

## What I'm Up To

* I'm this week's guest on [Popcorn Finance](https://popcornfinance.com/episode-055-taking-your-side-hustle-full-time-with-maggie-germano/)! Chris and I talked about how my business started as a side hustle and went to my full-time job. Take a listen and let me know what you think!

* [Money Circle is next Wednesday, April 25th!](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-deal-with-credit-card-debt/) We'll be talking about credit card debt and how to start making moves to get out of it. Don't worry if you're stressed or ashamed of your debt, Money Circle is a safe space where we can support each other and break the taboos around money. I hope to [see you there](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-deal-with-credit-card-debt/)!
