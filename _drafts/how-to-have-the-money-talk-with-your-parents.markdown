Have you every considered that it's important to talk about money with your parents? And I don't mean talking to them about your own money. I mean talking to them about their money, their financial circumstances, and their future. If you're like many people, this probably hasn't really crossed your mind. In fact, this wasn't something I really considered until my own grandparents and parents started getting older. But it's incredibly important to be starting these conversations and getting on the same page with our family as we, and they, get older.

But the truth is, even though these conversations are essential, they can be really tough to have! So tough, in fact, that many people avoid them completely, to their detriment and that of their families. I want to help to change that, starting with you!

## Approach Them With Kindness

The reason you are having the money talk with your parents is because you care about them and you want them to be well cared for. And that's the thing you need to keep at the top of your mind when you approach this conversation. Lead with how much you love them and how you just want to make sure that they feel safe and comfortable when it comes to their future. 

## Be Respectful, Not Judgmental

You might not be happy with what you learn about your parents' financial situation. Things might be less organized than you hoped. There might be no planning in place. There might be little to no money saved. If your parents are in a worse situation that you expected, it's easy to feel frustrated and judgmental. But this will just make 

## Don't Ask for Specific Numbers

The specific numbers are not necessary for you to know, especially if your parents are uncomfortable talking about money.

## Ask "What If" Questions

It can be hard to plan ahead when the future seems abstract. 

## Get Clear On Their Goals and Needs

## Encourage Them to Meet With Someone Else

You aren't here to solve all of your parents' financial problems. In fact, sometimes it can be detrimental to try to step in and take over. It's important to know when a third party will be most helpful. This could be any of the following:

* A lawyer to help them draft up their estate documents

* A financial advisor to help them sort out their retirement plans

* Legal aid to help them deal with any serious financial issues at hand

* A credit counselor to help them manage and pay down any debt

## Wait Until After the Holiday Gathering

It might seem like the holidays are a great time to sit down and have these conversations with your parents. I used to think that too, because often that's the only time we are with our family for prolonged periods of time! And it isn't that the holiday season is the wrong time to talk about money with your parents, it's that the timing is important. You shouldn't bring up estate planning or financials at the dinner table on Thanksgiving or while you're opening gifts on Christmas. This approach can make people feel extra defensive and embarrassed and derail the conversation quickly. Wait until the day after Thanksgiving to bring up these topics. And don't put your parents on the spot in front of the whole family.
