A few weeks ago, I spoke at a college leadership event in Virginia. I led a workshop that helped college students understand how to start their careers on the right financial foot. Overall, the presentation went very well. A lot of students in the audience clearly got a lot out of the content and many of them came up to me afterwards to ask more questions. However, there was one student, a young man, who seemed to find my presentation very amusing. He laughed to himself quietly throughout the entire thing. I mostly ignored him and continued to teach the room. At the end, though, he was one of those who came up to me. 

I was a little curious that he'd be approaching me, since he didn't seem to pay much attention to the presentation itself. At first, he asked me about the part of my work that is related to closing the wage gap. He asked if I am an activist for it or if I just teach salary negotiation tactics. I told him that I do both. Then he asked me if I know that the wage gap doesn't actually exist.
