Like many Americans, you may have received your stimulus check via direct deposit already. If you haven't yet received your deposit, or if you will get the money via check, visit this [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments) to get an update on your money. The site also gives you the opportunity to input your bank information so that you can get your money via direct deposit. The system has been pretty overloaded, so if it takes a couple of tries, or if you get an error message, keep at it.

When you do get the money, though, you might be wondering what you should do with it. Of course, that answer is going to depend on your circumstances. But here are some tips:

## Cover Your Necessities

The main reason we are even getting these stimulus checks is to try to tide us over during this crisis. The most important thing to do is to make sure that you and your family have what you need  in order to survive. So if you are losing any income during this time, you should make sure that you at least can put food on the table. Focus on things like food, medication, and other things that you and your family need in order to get by and maintain your health and safety.

## Pay Your Bills

If you know your necessities will be covered, you could use this money to pay your bills. However, it's also a good idea to try to keep as much cash on hand right now so that you don't risk going into debt trying to cover necessities. So a good step to take is to call your landlord, creditors, and other providers to ask about what coronavirus offerings they have. Many landlords, mortgage lenders, utility providers, and credit card companies are working with their customers to ease the financial burden right now. Make sure that you let them know that you have been personally impacted by COVID-19 when you call.

Once you've found out if you can delay paying your bills or at least forego any penalties, identify which bills you must pay right now. Consider which things you really can't live without right now, like your internet and your cell phone. Prioritize your bills based on necessity and whether or not the provider will let you delay or reduce payments.

## Pad Your Savings

If you don't have an emergency fund, or if you have one but it's small, you should use as much of this money as possible to help fund your savings. If COVID-19 doesn't show everyone why an emergency fund is so important, I don't know what will. My husband and I are putting a large majority of our stimulus money into our emergency fund, because this crisis has made us feel less stable and secure than we felt even just a couple of months ago. Plus, my husband got laid off from his last job just about four months ago, so we don't want to take any chances. Having cash on hand in case your income gets cut off or even just reduced is a good way to keep yourself afloat and avoid going into debt.

## Pay Down Debt

If you have a consistent income right now, you know that your necessities will be covered, AND you have some cash in savings, using the stimulus money to pay down some debt might be a good idea. It's not very often that an influx of cash will be coming in, so this could be an opportunity to get your debt balances down or paid off. That way, you won't have to worry as much about those payments moving forward. Only do this if you know that you have every other important thing covered.

## Invest In Your Community

If you still have your job and feel confident that you can cover your expenses and other priorities, consider investing in your community. Many of us are not in the position to do this, so don't feel guilty if you need to keep the whole stimulus check for yourself. But if you are lucky enough to have your needs cover, you can give back to your community in a few ways:

Buy from local businesses:

* Restaurants

* Liquor stores

* Book stores

* Artists

* Small grocery stores

Donate to local organizations:

* Food pantries

* Soup kitchens

* Nonprofits helping those in need

As always, you should put your own oxygen mask on first, literally and metaphorically. Take care of your needs first. Pay for your necessities, pay your bills, build up your savings, and pay off debt. Once you've been able to do that, then you can give to others.
