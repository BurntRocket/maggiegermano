## Travel

The funny thing about this guilt is it wasn't about the actual money I was spending. In fact, for years, I've prioritized saving for travel so that I can explore this world without guilt and without going into debt. I believe that if you love to travel, spending money (that you have) on it should never be a shameful thing. It only improves your quality of life.

The guilt I have felt has actually come after I've spoken to friends and family about my travel plans.

## My Wedding

This is one of the more acute times when I've felt guilty for spending money.

As a feminist and a financial coach, I'm very aware of how capitalism and the wedding industrial complex pressures people to overspend on their weddings. So I felt very strongly about not spending a lot on my wedding. When I received a settlement from a shoulder injury, I set aside $10,000 earmarked for my eventual wedding (we weren't even engaged yet - can you tell I like to plan ahead?). I was certain that $10,000 would be plenty for a wedding. Boy, was I wrong. In fact, we're paying more than double that amount for our wedding. And we're only having 130 people attend! And we are getting married an hour away from DC. And we pursued a lot of cost-cutting measures! The point is: weddings are incredibly expensive. We really wanted a wedding where we could invite almost everyone we love the most. Put those two things together and you have to spend quite a bit of money. Luckily, we have been able to save up the amount in full, and will not be going into debt for the wedding. In fact, we may have some money leftover afterwards, because we saved an extra 10% as a buffer.
