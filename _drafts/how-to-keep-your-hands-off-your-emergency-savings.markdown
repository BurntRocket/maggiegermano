An [emergency fund](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/you-need-an-emergency-fund) is one of the most important financial accounts you can have. It is there for you during the worst times in your life. It protects you from things like eviction, default, or bankruptcy. It has your back if you lose your job, end a relationship, or get sick or injured. If you haven't yet started to build your emergency fund, you should start today. Even if you're only putting $10 a month into it, that's better than nothing, and it'll grow faster than you think. But as you're able to contribute more, you should increase your contribution until you're able to fully fund it. You should have at least three to six months worth of expenses in this fund for it to be fully funded. 

However, it's one thing to build your emergency fund, and it's another thing to leave it alone. The point of an emergency fund is to use it for emergencies. If you use it for other things, like vacation or shopping, you'll run out of money and it won't be there when you actually need it.

It's always important to know and understand yourself and your habits, but it's especially true when it comes to money. If you know that you tend to transfer your savings into your checking when you're running low on money, you have to put some barriers into place.
