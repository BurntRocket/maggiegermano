Dan and I are getting married this Saturday (!!!???). It's been a pretty long engagement, and if we could do it over again, I'd rather get married sooner and spend much less time planning a wedding. But here we are, finally.

A couple of months ago, we teamed up with a therapist for pre-marital counseling. It was important to me for us to prepare for marriage by going through this counseling. We had attended an 8-hour pre-marital workshop in January and enjoyed it, but I knew we'd benefit from more support.

We couldn't find a pre-marital therapist that accepted insurance. Even though we would have to pay out of pocket, it was important to me, so I was willing to make the investment. I allocated a portion of my monthly income one month to make it happen.

## Figure Out Your Budget

## Find a Therapist in that Budget

## Schedule Your Sessions

Our therapist said that four to five 90-minute sessions is the typical amount that her clients commit to. 

## Put in the Work

Just like with most self-work, the work you do IN the session is not the only work you need to do. If your therapist gives you homework, do it, and don't just do it five minutes before your session. Practice the communication tactics that you learn in the sessions. Keep in mind the things that your partner has mentioned. Pre-marital counseling (just like any therapy) won't be effective if you're not taking the lessons home with you.

## Don't End the Conversation There

After pre-marital counseling is done, all of your problems are not miraculously solved. You have to continue communicating your needs and practicing effective communication.
