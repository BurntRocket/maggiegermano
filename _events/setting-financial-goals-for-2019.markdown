The first Money Circle meetup in January is a special one! We're teaming up with Deri Freeman, a Financial Planner with Prudential Advisors, to set financial goals for 2019.

Setting specific, measurable goals is the key to being more likely to achieve your goals. It's also important to make sure that those goals align with what you *really* want to see in your life, not what you or others think you *should* do. At this month's Money Circle, Maggie will teach you how to set goals that motivate you and align with your values. Deri will then share quick and easy steps you can take now that will have you hitting your financial goals all year long - not just in January!
