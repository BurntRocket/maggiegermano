Happy Friday, everyone! Here's what I was up to (while mostly on vacation) this week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my ongoing client's monthly fee went through on Monday

* A new client paid her monthly fee.

* We had two different Airbnb guests stay with us. 

* An affiliate payout for Podia was transferred to my Paypal account.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I spent the majority of this week in Wildwood, New Jersey with my sisters and two of my cousins. We brought much of our food with us and mostly spent our time on the beach, but we still spent a bit of money dining out. We got delicious seafood at [Rick's Seafood](http://www.ricks-seafood.com/), we got tacos and margaritas at [Buckets Margarita Bar & Cantina](http://bucketsstoneharbor.com/), and we had a farewell breakfast at a diner in North Wildwood.  

* I originally purchased a train ticket that would get me back to Maryland at 6:30pm last night. However, I found out that my sisters and cousins were planning on getting on the road by 11am to get home, so I paid Amtrak $20 to change my ticket to a 1pm train. They don't have change fees, luckily, but I did have to pay the difference in the ticket price.

* I also bought a few snacks at the Amtrak station in Philadelphia.

* While I was gone, Dan tried out doggy daycare for Bruno. He dropped Bruno off at [All Dogs Club](https://www.alldogsclub.com/) on Tuesday and Thursday. Bruno loves it there, but it's a bit pricey so we probably won't do it unless we absolutely need to. 

* Here's some proof that no matter how particular you are with your money, you can still screw up and get charged fees! Our car insurance company charged the balance of our new car insurance premium this week, which was a month later than the actual due date. I had no idea that was happening, so there wasn't enough money in our checking account to cover it. I had just paid all of our other bills, so we usually don't keep much in the account between the end of the month and Dan's paycheck on the 15th. We got charged $25 for overdrafting, which I still need to call and ask them to waive. We'll see what happens.

## **What I’m Reading**

I read the entirety of *[Big Little Lies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486412-big-little-lies)* by Liane Moriarty while at the beach this week. It was just as riveting as the HBO show, even though it ended differently. Now I can't wait to watch the second season! After finishing that book, I started *[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power?from_search=true)* by Naomi Alderman. It's fascinating so far.
