## Don't Buy Decorations Early

## Pay for the Important Stuff First

## Track Everything

Tracking spending is always important, but that's especially true when you're spending large amounts. 

## Add a 10% Buffer

Things will most likely come up. Your guest list might be higher than originally estimated, or maybe you forgot you have to tip some of your vendors. Regardless, you should build in a spending buffer of 10%. This will protect you in the case of emergencies or unexpected costs.
