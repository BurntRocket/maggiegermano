You KNOW the holidays are almost here. You've been inundated with ads since before Halloween. Christmas music has been playing on the radio for almost a month. Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday have come and gone. But just in case you haven't already spent all of your money on holiday gifts, here are some questions you should ask yourself when planning your budget.

## Who are you buying for?

Regardless of what Capitalism tells us, you don't actually have to buy a gift for everyone you know. If you can't afford to buy gifts for everyone who is important to you, you have to prioritize. So, who are the people you absolutely need to buy gifts for this year? You can make a tier 1 and tier 2 list, based on what your budget will end up being.

## How much do you have to spend?

Be realistic. How much money can you spend without going into debt or not being able to pay your rent in January?

## How much can you spend on each person?

So now you know how many gifts you want to buy and how much you can spend total. That pretty much determines how much you should be spending on each gift. If you want all the gifts to be fairly equal in cost, divide your total budget by the number of people you're shopping for. 

## What is influencing you to spend money?

Are you feeling pressured to buy someone a gift? Where is that pressure coming from? Figure out if it's a sincere desire to make that person feel special, or if there is another reason. Spending money on someone is not the only way to show that you care, and it's not the most important way! Some people's [love language](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/) is gift-giving and/or receiving gifts, but others aren't wired that way. 

## Are there low-cost or free gifts you can give?

Okay, maybe you've decided that you do want to give a gift to all of your close friends and family. That's so generous! But assuming you don't have unlimited funds, you're going to have to get creative. Brainstorm some things that are inexpensive or free that you can give as gifts. You don't have to spend a bunch of money to make a gift worthwhile. 

One thing I like to ask people is: what is something that you're really good at? What do people compliment you on or ask you for? If you find your friends constantly asking you to bake cookies for them, maybe your gift this year can be an assortment of your favorite Christmas cookies! (Sidenote: I'm always accepting [peanut butter blossoms](https://www.hersheys.com/kitchens/en_us/recipes/peanut-butter-blossoms.html).) Or maybe you really have a way with words and your mom would be happy with a thoughtful card instead of an expensive necklace.
