*This is a continuation of my celebration of women during Women's History Month. Read my piece about philanthropists [here](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/10-Amazing-Philanthropists-Uplifting-Other-Women/).*

When I sat down to write this article, the entrepreneurs who kept popping into my head are those who work in personal finance. Maybe I'm biased. But hey, this is a personal finance blog, so let's talk about women who want to help you get your money right!

## Alexa Von Tobel

Alexa Von Tobel is the founder and CEO of LearnVest, a personal finance website and budgeting program. Alexa might actually be the reason I became a financial coach for women. Years ago, I stumbled upon LearnVest, bought her book [Financially Fearless](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DTEMGF6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), and saw her speak on her book tour. Her story and passion for financial health really left a mark on me.  I still use LearnVest as my budgeting tool, and share their advice.

## Tonya Rapley

Tonya Rapley is the creator of [My Fab Finance](www.myfabfinance.com), which she started to use her own story and experiences to empower women and girls of all ages with tools needed to change their lives. 

## Amanda Steinberg

[Amanda Steinberg](https://www.amandasteinberg.net/) is the founder of [DailyWorth](dailyworth.com), a woman-focused personal finance website, and [WorthFM](worthfm.com), a digital investing service for women. She launched DailyWorth in 2009 to create a space where financial advice was geared towards people who are not part of the financial industry. I've been a subscriber and avid reader for years. Amanda decided to create WorthFM when she realized that good advice doesn't necessarily make investing accessible to everyone. She also recently released her first book, [Worth It](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO3468W/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).

## Tiffany Aliche

Sallie Krawcheck is the CEO and co-founder of [Ellevest](ellevest.com), a digital investment advisor for women, and the owner and chair of [Ellevate Network](ellevatenetwork.com), a professional women's network. I personally use Ellevest for my IRA and other investments.
