Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* We had a guest from Belgium stay in our Airbnb all week. She was visiting for a conference at UMD.

* Dan got his bi-monthly paycheck on Monday.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I were in Los Angeles from Saturday night until Wednesday afternoon. We tried to keep our spending fairly low (aside from the things Dan could expense), but we did have a little bit of fun! We had drinks in the cool hotel bar, tried out a local brewery, and saw the live show of Put Your Hands Together at UCB Franklin. We also ate quite a bit of food.

* We bought the final flight we'll be taking while in Thailand for our honeymoon! 

* I treated myself to this [Unladylike pin](https://unladylike.co/shop/unladylike-pin) and can't wait to wear it around.

* We are trying out another meal delivery kit, this time it's [Home Chef](https://www.homechef.com). I had a coupon for $35 off my first order, so we're getting a bunch of meals for a great price. [Get $30 off your first order if you use my link!](https://www.homechef.com/invite/vVKxdzswbJvdB)

## What I’m Writing

This week, I wrote about how to throw an [affordable bachelorette party](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-throw-a-bachelorette-party-that-wont-break-the-bank/). I  used these tips for my own bachelorette party, so I hope they work for you!

## What I’m Up To

* I’m participating in a salary negotiation workshop for the [Public Leadership Education Network](https://plen.org/) (PLEN) tomorrow! I’m excited to chat with college students about negotiating for their future.

* I’m joining Emilie Aries for a [live podcast taping](https://www.facebook.com/events/177486379757315/) of the Bossed Up podcast on Monday, October 22nd! We’ll be talking all about women and money. Tickets are free - [see you there](https://www.facebook.com/events/177486379757315/)?

* Next month, [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) is meeting to talk about [how to ask for a raise](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-ask-for-a-raise/) at your current job. If you know you’ll have to do this soon, [join us](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-ask-for-a-raise-tickets-49618103082) on October 24th!

## What I’m Excited About

* I was quoted in an [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/how-being-lazy-can-actually-help-you-save-money-ncna920471) piece this week! I talked to Holly Trantham of [The Financial Diet](https://thefinancialdiet.com/) about how automation can help you get your money right.
