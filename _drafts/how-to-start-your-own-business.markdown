October is National Women's Small Business Month! [As of 2015](https://www.nawbo.org/resources/women-business-owner-statistics), 9.1 million business in the United States were owned by women, 2.9 million of which are owned by women of color. These businesses generate $1.4 trillion dollars in sales. This has been a huge increase from years past. So basically, women are kicking ass in business!

Are you interested in starting your own small business? Obviously, you're not alone, so I want to help you get started. It can be a lot less intimidating when you know what your initial steps should be.

## Narrow in on your idea

## Come up with a name

You need an official business name in order to legally start a business. This name will be on your legal paperwork, on any business bank accounts or credit cards you open, and on your tax forms. You'll probably also use it on your website and other public platforms. So make sure you like it! I personally could not come up with a name that I trusted I'd like long-term. I didn't want to end up changing the name later on and possibly losing some of my audience. That's why I ended up just using my own name. I know my name won't change (even after I get married), so I trust that there won't be a reason to change it. 

Make sure the name you choose reflects what your business is meant to do. And make sure you'll feel proud and excited to introduce your business to strangers.
