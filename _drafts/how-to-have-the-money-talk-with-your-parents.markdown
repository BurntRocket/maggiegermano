Have you every considered that it's important to talk about money with your parents? And I don't mean talking to them about your own money. I mean talking to them about their money, their financial circumstances, and their future. If you're like many people, this probably hasn't really crossed your mind. In fact, this wasn't something I really considered until my own grandparents and parents started getting older. But it's incredibly important to be starting these conversations and getting on the same page with our family as we, and they, get older.

If you want to learn more about having these conversations, check out this week's Money Circle podcast, where I chat with Cameron Huddleston, author of Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk.
