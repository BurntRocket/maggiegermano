Happy Friday! I hope you had a fantastic week. Here’s what I was up to!

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* We had two sets of Airbnb guests this week.

* One of my new clients paid for her first month of coaching.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I think I mentioned this last week, but we had to get our basement shower completely demolished and rebuilt. The floor was cracked and leaking into the surrounding walls and floor. We paid the deposit for the work last week and the remaining balance this week. Thank goodness it's tax deductible as a business expense. Not only did we have to pay the contractor, but we also had to buy extra paint to touch up the parts of the kitchen that needed to be re-patched.

* I mentioned before that Dan and I are using [Sun Basket](https://sunbasket.com/invite/Mary1915063) for meal delivery until the wedding. We've been so stressed with all the life things going on that we haven't been able to feed ourselves healthy food. So we were charged this week for next week's meals. Use [my link](https://sunbasket.com/invite/Mary1915063) to sign up for $40 off your first order!

* I spent Wednesday in the city for meetings and the YWCA event. I bought a couple cups of tea and a chocolate chip scone (yum). 

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about how I saved up for my wedding while doing lots of other expensive things! [Check it out.](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-i-saved-money-for-my-wedding-while-buying-a-house-and-quitting-my-job/)

## **What I’m Up To**

* This past Wednesday, I spoke at the YWCA NCA Young Women's Leadership Council's [Women, Wealth, and Wine](https://www.facebook.com/events/261331111177190/). I talked with two groups of women about paying down debt, and had a great time!

* I'm participating in a salary negotiation workshop for the [Public Leadership Education Network](https://plen.org/) (PLEN) on Saturday, October 20th. I'm excited to chat with college students about negotiating for their future.

* I'm joining Emilie Aries for a [live podcast taping](https://www.facebook.com/events/177486379757315/) of the Bossed Up podcast on Monday, October 22nd! We'll be talking all about women and money. Tickets are free - [see you there](https://www.facebook.com/events/177486379757315/)?

* Next month, [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) is meeting to talk about [how to ask for a raise](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-ask-for-a-raise/) at your current job. If you know you’ll have to do this soon, [join us](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-ask-for-a-raise-tickets-49618103082) on October 24th!

* If you can't make it to Money Circle this month, join us in [December](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-how-to-plan-for-holiday-spending-tickets-50456857820) to talk about how to plan ahead for holiday spending. You'll be super prepared for next year!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* My wedding is coming up in just over a month! I'm really excited for the day to finally be here. I'm also incredibly excited to no longer be planning a wedding. It's not for the faint of heart. 

* Dan and I are heading to Los Angeles next weekend. (I know, wtf are we doing traveling less than a month before the wedding?) But Dan was invited to attend a conference for free, including his flight and hotel stay, so I used Southwest points to join him. I'm meeting up with a couple fellow women in finance while I'm there. What else should I be sure to do?
