Happy Friday, everyone! I’m back to business after traveling for over a week. Here’s what I was up to.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* One of my retainer clients paid her monthly fee.

* One of my ongoing clients paid her monthly fee.

* A new client paid for a one-time coaching session.

* We've had an Airbnb client staying in our basement since Sunday.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* This past weekend, Dan and I knocked down a bunch of shelves in our master bathroom, which meant that the walls needed to be patched and repainted. We decided to repaint the whole bathroom while we were at it. So we bought paint and some painting supplies on Sunday.

* Dan did our weekly grocery run at Whole Foods.

* I had a follow-up appointment at my new functional medicine doctor in downtown DC on Monday. They don't take insurance, so I wrote them a check for the appointment.

* Since I've been working from home, I wear a lot of very comfortable clothes. My sweatpants have gotten pretty worn down (and have some holes from Bruno's puppy teeth), so I ordered a new pair from [Pact](http://fbuy.me/nlgoJ). I also ordered two tank tops while I was there.

* I don't think I've written about this before but I'm a big supporter of menstrual cups. They are a convenient, sustainable, healthy way to manage your period every month. After having my period on the cruise a few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to try out a new menstrual cup. I decided to buy a new one from [Flex](https://flexcup.com/). Flex usually sells disposable menstrual discs, but they just released a menstrual cup that has a ring at the bottom, which makes it much easier to remove. I wouldn't say I'm excited to try it during my next period, but I'm looking forward to the added convenience!

* This week, my doctor told me that I should consider cutting back on gluten. Somehow, I'm not devastated by this revelation. I'm feeling motivated to find other healthy options. My first stop, obviously, was finding gluten-free sweets. I ordered a 5 pack of mug cakes from my friend [Alli Owen's](http://alliowen.com/) company, [Primal Noms](https://primalnoms.com/). 

* This morning, I had breakfast at Whole Foods with my friend [Alyssa Best](http://alyssabest.com/), who is a career coach in the DC area. 

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about [wedding loans](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/dont-take-out-a-wedding-loan/) and why I don't believe anyone should go into debt for their wedding day.

## **What I’m Up To**

* Last week, I was quoted in a [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/money-questions-ask-every-week-month-year-2019-7) article about what money questions you should be asking yourself.

* The [July Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-improving-your-credit-score-tickets-63873388023) is up! We’re revisiting the idea of how to improve your credit score. You’ll learn about what impacts your credit score and then what steps you need to take to improve it over time. Register today!

* I’ve been hinting at starting a podcast for a while now. But in order to make sure the podcast is interesting and helpful for YOU, I want to make sure I’m answering your questions. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit any and all money questions that you have!

## What I'm Excited About

I chatted this week with my friend Allison Hamilton-Rohe of [Daily Outfit](https://dailyoutfit.com/) about her [style coaching program](https://dailyoutfit.thinkific.com/courses/signature-style-journey-master-class-fall-2019). I've never loved shopping for clothes, but it's become much harder for me to find clothes that I am happy with and feel good in. I'm considering joining her group coaching program, which begins in September. If you're interesting in signing up, use the code **special20 **to get 20% off!

## **What I’m Reading**

I finally finished *[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power?ac=1&from_search=true)* by Naomi Alderman. I loved the plot, but for some reason, I found it hard to get through the whole book. Now, I'm moving on to nonfiction and I'm reading *[Doing Harm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30653955-doing-harm)* by Maya Dusenbery. I'm only a few pages in and I'm already furious. 

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

That's all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
