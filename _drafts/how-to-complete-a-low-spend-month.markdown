New year, new budget. Do you want to take control of your money this year? Start off strong by doing a low-spend January! I’m sure you’ve heard of Dry January, where you commit to not drinking any alcohol for 30 days. Well, there are also “no-spend” months, but I prefer to call them “low-spend” months, because it’s impossible to spend NO money at all.

What does a low-spend month look like? You only spend money on the necessities: rent, utilities, transportation, subscriptions, loans, groceries, etc. Anything that is not essential or required, like going out to eat or going shopping, is not allowed.

What is the point of this exercise? Not only will it help you spend much less this month (and hopefully you'll put that extra cash into savings or toward debt), but it will also show you what you really don’t need to be spending money on. It will also show you that you’re capable of cutting back on spending if you put your mind to it.

So how does it work?

## Make a list of all the essentials that you must pay for

If you've already made a budget, you'll have this list ready. If not, this is also a great exercise to get you halfway to having a budget! List out all of the things that you *know* you have to pay for every month. This could be obvious things like rent, utilities, your student loan payment, etc. But it could also be co-pays for a prescription, metro fare, gas, groceries, and more. These should be things that you know you can't avoid paying for. It's helpful to have this list because you know you don't have to feel guilty for spending on these things while cutting back in other areas.

## Make a list of all the non-essentials that you will be giving up

Get clear on the things that you know you want to give up or cut way back on during your low-spend month. This could be going out to eat, shopping, Uber, coffee, etc. It's especially helpful if it's something that you know you overspend on during a typical month. 

## Check in at least once a week to see how you’re doing

Just like with budgeting and tracking your spending, it's important to check in regularly when you're challenging yourself to spend much less than usual. 

## Write down how you’re feeling about the challenge

## Make a list of what was easy to give up and what was hard

At the end of this, you’ll have a good idea of what you can go without from now on! Make a list of the things that you actually didn't mind giving up, and cut back on those in your normal day-to-day. You’ll see that it’s actually possible to cut your spending if you put your mind to it.
