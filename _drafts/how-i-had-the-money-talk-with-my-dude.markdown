One of the first articles I ever wrote about money was about how to have the [money talk](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/have-the-money-talk) with your romantic partner. It's so, so important to talk about money with the person you're sharing your life with. It sets expectations, opens up the conversation about your financial goals, and makes sure that everyone is on the same page. It will also help you to understand each other and your relationship with money. Money impacts every area of our lives, including our romantic lives, so this is not a conversation that you should skip.

## I Started Early

I remember the moment I first talked to Dan about money. It was probably our fourth or fifth date and we were walking towards my apartment, where I was going to make dinner for him. Dan was carrying a bouquet of flowers for me. I turned to him and casually asked him if he had any credit card debt.

## I Communicated My Needs

When Dan and I first started dating, we obviously went out a lot. We went out for dinner, we went to movies, we went out to brunch, etc. At first, Dan paid for me much of the time, but once I found out how much he was earning in salary, I didn't feel comfortable letting him cover everything (we were making similar income and it wasn't a lot!). We began splitting costs from time to time, but eventually, that spending started to conflict with my budget and savings goals.

## I Practiced Non-Judgment

This is still a tricky thing for me, especially in my personal life. When it comes to my clients, I never judge them or make them feel bad about their money choices.  When I am directly affected by someone's money habits, it's difficult for me to react in the same calm way.

## I Continue the Conversation

As with most important topics, it's crucial to continue the money conversation over time. Priorities change, income changes, expenses change. These can be good things or they can be difficult things. The point is, the conversation must evolve as life evolves.

Dan and my situation is much different now than it was when we first started dating. We own a home together, we've both paid off our student loans, we've combined most of our finances, Dan has more than doubled his income, I've cut mine in half (for now!) by pursuing self-employment,
