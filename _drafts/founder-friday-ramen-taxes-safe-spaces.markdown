TGIF!

## How I Earned Money This Week

* Two of my clients' monthly payments went through this week.

* We had so many Airbnb guests this week! Now that we're fairly established as hosts, the payments go through on the day that the guests check in.

* I finally filed my taxes! This year was tough, because so much has changed. I bought a house, changed states, and increased my self-employment revenue. Luckily, I'm getting a hefty tax refund, and the majority of it will go towards our wedding savings.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan and I celebrated our 4th anniversary this Wednesday (Pi Day ftw)! We had dinner at the wonderful [Toki Underground](https://www.tokiunderground.com/).

## What I’m Excited About

* Tickets for Collective Action for Safe Spaces' [Safe Space Jam](https://collectiveactiondc.givezooks.com/events/safe-space-jam-2018) are officially on sale! Early bird tickets are available until March 24th. CASS works everyday to make DC a safer place for everyone, and this annual event is a great way to support their work, meet the community, and bid on some great silent auction items. I hope to see you there! PS: if you're not in the DC area, you can still support CASS by [donating](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/collectiveactiondc).

* I'm leading a personal finance workshop at Varnish Lane nail salon for their first Varnish Lane After Hours event! Join us on [Thursday, April 5th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/varnish-lane-after-hours-personal-finances-tickets-44203571071)!

## What I’m Fan-Girling Over

* [Invoice the Patriarchy](http://www.artpatti.com/invoice-the-patriarchy/): Artist and stay-at-home mom Patti Maciesz started this project to show the impact of the unpaid labor that women do all the time. You can [calculate what your own salary](https://www.billthepatriarchy.com/) would be, based on all the unpaid labor that you do everyday. 

* [Missing & Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams and Finding Cleo](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/missing-murdered-who-killed-alberta-williams/). I listen to a LOT of podcasts. And many of them are true crime and/or investigative podcasts. And I've noticed that most of these podcasts are made by, about, and for white people. People of color are nearly invisible in this genre. However, with podcasts like Missing & Murdered, hopefully that is starting to change. This podcast is led by investigative reporter and Indigenous woman, [Connie Walker](http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/meet-our-team-connie-walker-1.2449140). In the two seasons so far, Connie investigates the murders of two different Indigenous women. I'm grateful to her for shining a light on these stories and searching for justice.
