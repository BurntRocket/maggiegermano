**Disclaimer:** *This article is going to be super heteronormative. I’m speaking about my own experience, and based on the research that has been conducted so far. Unfortunately, much of the research has only focused on heterosexual (white?) couples. I will include some stats about gay couples, but most of this article will focus on my thoughts on heterosexual marriage, as that’s what I’m about to enter into! I’d love to hear your experience as someone in a same-sex marriage (or otherwise), so please do share in the comments!*

80-9% of American women take their husband's last name after they get married. Only 3% of men take their wife’s last name.

I would love to say that I don't hold any judgment for women who do change their names, but I am still a human. I believe that women should make whatever choice they feel best about, and if that means changing their name, go for it! But I'd be lying if I said I didn't bristle a little bit every time a friend changes their name on Facebook the day after their wedding. 

The history of a woman taking her husband’s name. 

What I feel like I’d be losing:

* my identity

* My deep connection with my family

* My principles 

* My domain name 

* My name recognition for my biz

I honestly don’t know what we’ll do with our kids’ names. We’ve been talking about that a lot lately, and haven’t come to a real agreement. In fact, it's been a point of contention, because we both have the same arguments for our kids having either of our last names. I do think it’s unfair that a woman is not present in her children’s identity (name). We give birth, we are still the primary caregiver. We are just as much an influential parent as a father may be. Why can’t our children carry our names? 
  
I’m not keen on a hyphenated name (Germano-Rader). The idea of using our couple name (Radermano) seems perfect and adorable but also isn’t a name (but what’s in a name? Aren’t they all made up?). Dan has suggested that we use my last name as our kids’ middle names but that isn’t super appealing to me either.
