Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about how we can all continue to [support domestic violence victims](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-support-victims-of-domestic-violence/) now that Domestic Violence Awareness Month is ending. Basically, much of it comes down to philanthropy, but being open and kind can go a long way too.

## **What I’m Saying**

* This week, [I interviewed](https://www.maggiegermano.com/podcast/how-to-prepare-and-protect-yourself-in-case-you-get-divorced/) attorney Rebecca G. Neale about the financial implications of divorce and what steps you should take if you're considering that route. 

* Fill out [this questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform) to submit your own money questions for the podcast. Nothing is too big or too small! If you or someone you know would make a great guest, [submit your name](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScz6LcFar3rRZ64vdkdq--A51Ei7pwzL4e8C514tjaeokSMhA/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

## **What I’m Up To**

* I released tickets for the [November Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/saving-all-year-for-big-expenses-tickets-77401711603) meetup! We’ll be talking about how to plan and save all year so that we can afford big expenses. Hope to see you on November 20th!

* I’m doing some thinking about what topics I want to cover in upcoming Money Circle meetups in Washington, DC. Send your preferences in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9h1xvbIg9UctjkOCfY7hWgAz5O1lOn07xX6ztEyiE3r96Uw/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

* I’ve created a virtual [Money Circle membership program](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)! If you are not located in the DC area, or if you just want more connection through Money Circle, this program is for you. There are 3 tiers that offer different options at different price points. There is a group coaching component and even a level that lets you check in with me every month. [Sign up today!](https://maggiegermano.podia.com/inner-circle)

## **What I’m Excited About**

* We're leaving for Peru in exactly a week from today! I've been wanting to take this trip for about a decade, so I cannot wait!

* We are also planning a trip to Japan in January! It's an extension of a work trip that Dan is taking, but it's the trip that Dan has been wanting to take since he was in high school. If you have recommendations, please send them our way!

* We hosted our very first Halloween party, and it was a hit! Dan and I dressed up as the kids from [Moonrise Kingdom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1748122/) and made Bruno into our very own doggy boy scout. Please enjoy the picture below:

## **What I’m Reading**

I'm currently reading *[The Witch Elm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46007673-the-witch-elm?from_search=true)* by Tana French. I loved her Murder Squad series, so I was excited to start this one. It's a little less exciting than the series, but I'm barely 25% into it, so hopefully it picks up. Lindy West's new book *[The Witches Are Coming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38362811-the-witches-are-coming)* is coming out next week and I can't wait to get started on that!

## **Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend**

That’s all from me this week. Have a great weekend!
