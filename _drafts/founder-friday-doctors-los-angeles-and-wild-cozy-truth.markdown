## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Dan and I sent the final payment to both our photographer and florist this week. It doesn't feel great to be writing huge checks to multiple people, but it's nice to know that we already have all that money in the bank.

## **What I’m Up To**

* I was featured on the Wild Cozy Truth podcast with Renee M. Powers this week! We chatted about feminism, money, homebuying, and more. I loved chatting with Renee, so check it out and let me know what you think!

* I’m participating in a salary negotiation workshop for the [Public Leadership Education Network](https://plen.org/) (PLEN) on Saturday, October 20th. I’m excited to chat with college students about negotiating for their future.

* I’m joining Emilie Aries for a [live podcast taping](https://www.facebook.com/events/177486379757315/) of the Bossed Up podcast on Monday, October 22nd! We’ll be talking all about women and money. Tickets are free - [see you there](https://www.facebook.com/events/177486379757315/)?

* Next month, [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) is meeting to talk about [how to ask for a raise](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/how-to-ask-for-a-raise/) at your current job.

## What I’m Excited About

* My [speaker page](https://www.maggiegermano.com/speaking/) is up and live on my website! I’m expanding my business to include more public speaking and workshops. I want to reach more women to spread financial literacy at a level that is more affordable and accessible for them. [Check it out](https://www.maggiegermano.com/speaking/) and reach out if you’d like to hire me for your event!

* Dan and I are heading to Los Angeles this weekend. I'm excited to meet up with a couple ladies in finance and get to know them better. I'm also super excited to go to the live show of Put Your Hands Together. If you haven't yet checked out that podcast, what are you waiting for??
