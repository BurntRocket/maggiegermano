I'm not an expert on financial regulation, by any means. But I do know that after living through (and graduating during) the Great Recession, I am very supportive of regulation that protects consumers.

**Why was the Fiduciary Rule put into place?**

Before I go into detail on the Fiduciary Rule, let's take a walk down memory lane. The Great Recession was a major worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008 and continued into 2010 and beyond.

As a result of the Great Recession and its aftermath, the U.S. government enacted some regulation.

**What's a fiduciary anyway?**

In a financial context, a fiduciary is required to act in the best interest of the person or party whose assets they're managing. If your investment advisor is a registered investment advisor, they have a fiduciary responsibility and are required to act in your best interest. However, many brokers, insurance professionals, and others in the financial industry do not.

The fiduciary rule was formally proposed by the Department of Labor in April 2016 and was passed shortly thereafter. The rule is currently scheduled to be phased in from April 10, 2017 through January 1, 2018. The fiduciary rule is designed to make all financial professionals who provide retirement planning advice or work with retirement plans accountable to the fiduciary standard.

**What happens now?**

On Friday, February 3rd, Trump ordered the Department of Labor to "review" the fiduciary rule. This was not an executive order, or a demand that the rule be rescinded. However, it has left brokerage firms and others on "Wall Street" confused. Honestly, I think we might end up having to wait and see.

**Is there a silver lining?**

I think so. In response to the fiduciary rule, firms have already begun to change their business models to comply. It's unclear whether or not they would reverse course if the rule was deferred. 

**So, who can you trust with your money?**

Look for companies that already have your best interest in mind. I think it's especially important to find companies that had your best interest at heart from the beginning, not just because they were ordered to. You don't want to have to keep checking whether or not your management firm has changed their business model. Some examples are [Ellevest](ellevest.com) and [WorthFM](worthfm.com). Bonus: they are owned by women and run for women. These particular companies can manage your IRAs and other investment accounts. I personally just moved my investments to Ellevest and I'm excited about it! (They even sent me flowers when I first opened my account.)
