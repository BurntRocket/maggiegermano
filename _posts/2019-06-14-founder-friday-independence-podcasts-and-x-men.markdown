Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to this week.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* On Monday, I spoke on a panel at the Women at the Wheel event put on by Prudential (I was on the same panel as Farnoosh Torabi!). It was a paid event and I'm waiting for the invoice to get paid.

* Three of my ongoing clients paid for their monthly fee.

* A new client paid for their one-time coaching session.

* We had an Airbnb guest stay with us this entire week.

* Dan's bi-weekly paycheck came in today.

## How I Spent Money This Week

* Dan stopped at Whole Foods for our big grocery run on Sunday. I stopped at Whole Foods on Tuesday for a few additional items. 

* Since Dan and I discovered that our movie theater sells $6 tickets on Tuesdays, we have been trying to go to the movies on Tuesday evenings when we don't have other commitments. This week, we went to see X-Men: Dark Phoenix. I adore the X-Men franchise and was excited to see Sophie Turner as the lead in this film. Unfortunately, the movie was pretty bad, and I wouldn't really recommend it.

* Father's Day is this coming Sunday, so my sisters and I went in on a gift for our dad.

* My little sister's birthday was on Wednesday, so Dan and I bought her a gift from her Etsy wishlist. 

* I met with my health coach in Petworth this Wednesday. I decided to drive, since it's a lot more direct than the metro right now. I paid about $4 for metered parking.

* I hadn't had a haircut in probably 6 months, because I'm having a hard time finding a hairdresser that is both in a convenient area and also good at cutting my hair! I finally decided to try out [Bananas Hair Design](https://bananashairdesign.com/) in College Park and it went pretty well. I'm currently growing out my hair so it's in an awkward spot, but the hairdresser cleaned this up and was very friendly. I'll probably go again in a couple months and see how things go.

* Since we got a corgi, we've been pretty tuned into the corgi meetups in the DC and Maryland area. We haven't been to one yet, but we bought a ticket for Bruno to attend a corgi pool party at the end of July. I can't wait to go and I will be sharing lots of pictures on [my](https://www.instagram.com/maggiegermano/) and [Bruno's](https://www.instagram.com/bruno.the.corg/) Instagram!

## What I’m Writing

Money and relationships are very tricky things to manage. When you combine the two, it can get even harder. This week, I wrote about how to [maintain your independence](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-maintain-financial-independence-after-merging-finances/) even while you merge finances with a partner.

## What I’m Up To

* The [June Money Circle meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-visualizing-your-money-goals-tickets-62153044429) is next Wednesday, June 19th! At this event, we’ll be visualizing our money goals so that they’re more motivating and easier to track. See you there?

* I’ve been hinting at starting a podcast for a while now. But in order to make sure the podcast is interesting and helpful for YOU, I want to make sure I’m answering your questions. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75z5itnYO-XOLStoqY5FXwuf8YI37ye5OD21Wv7tBGAqIVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit any and all money questions that you have!

## What I'm Excited About

* This week, I discovered a podcast called [By The Book](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/stitcher/by-the-book) with [Jolenta Greenberg](http://www.jolentagreenberg.com/) and [Kristen Meinzer](https://www.kristenmeinzer.com/). For each episode, they read a different self help book and life by the teachings for two weeks and then report back. It's really enlightening and also very funny. I recommend it!

* Our 5-month-old puppy, Bruno, graduated from obedience training this week! He had to pass several different exercises that he learned over 10 weeks, and he did! Granted, he came in 4th place out of six puppies, but hey, he still passed! There's still a lot of work to be done, but he at least knows how to sit and stay now!

## What I’m Reading

I'm still reading  ***[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power?from_search=true)*** by Naomi Alderman, but I also just started *[Red, White, and Royal Blue](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41150487-red-white-royal-blue)* by Casey McQuiston since it's the June pick for my book club. It's fun so far and I can't wait to dig in more.

## Money Tip to Take Into the Weekend
