Happy Friday, everyone! Here’s what I was up to.

## How I Earned Money This Week

* I got paid for an upcoming speaking engagement.

* I finally received the check for a speaking engagement I did in June.

* Dan got his bi-weekly paycheck on Wednesday.

* One of my retainer clients paid her monthly fee.

* One of my ongoing clients paid her monthly fee.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* On Sunday, we went on our weekly grocery run at Whole Foods. We also stopped by Safeway to pick up one thing that was too expensive at Whole Foods. 

* On Wednesday,  I had drinks with a friend. In fact, I still need to Venmo her the cost of my drinks!

* Since yesterday was August 1st, that means that my monthly budget has reset. So I bought a couple things that we've been needing around the house but that didn't fit into our July budget.

## **What I’m Writing**

* This week, [on my blog](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-manage-your-business-finances-as-an-entrepreneur/), I wrote about how business owners can take care of their business finances from the very beginning.

* Over on my [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiegermano/2019/07/29/how-women-can-improve-their-financial-optimism-despite-growing-anxieties/) column, I wrote about how women's anxiety about money is increasing as they take more control over their finances. 

## **What I’m Up To**

* The [August Money Circle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-dealing-with-money-shame-tickets-66476917249) meetup is scheduled and ready for you! In August, we’ll be talking about money shame, how others feel the same way, and how to improve our relationship with our money. [See you there!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/money-circle-dealing-with-money-shame-tickets-66476917249)
