According to research professor, [Brené Brown](https://brenebrown.com/), there is a big difference between shame and guilt. She says that "...guilt is adaptive and helpful – it’s holding something we’ve done or failed to do up against our values and feeling psychological discomfort." Shame, on the other hand, is "the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging – something we’ve experienced, done, or failed to do makes us unworthy of connection." To simplify that for you: guilt is the feeling that we've *done* something bad and shame is feeling that *we* are bad.

> To simplify that for you: guilt is the feeling that we've *done* something bad and shame is feeling that *we* are bad.

Why is that distinction important? According to Brené's research, shame is actually not helpful at all. In fact, it can lead people to destructive and hurtful behavior. Contrarily, guilt can be a motivating emotion. It can encourage people to make more beneficial decisions and change their behavior for the better.

And what does this have to do with money? Well, shame comes up a lot when it comes to money. In our society, we put a lot of value on financial standing, and we tend to blame ourselves if we aren't keeping up with our peers.

## Talk to Your Loved Ones About Money

The more we open up about something, the less isolated and ashamed we will feel. I guarantee that you know people who have made the same decisions or been in the same positions as you have. But you won't know that if you don't open up about where you are and where you've been. Feeling alone in our experiences means we will feel isolated and more likely to beat ourselves up.

## Forgive Yourself for Your Past Decisions

I've said it before and I'll say it again: you have to forgive yourself for the financial mistakes you've made in the past. It's normal to be frustrated and wish that you'd done something different, but it won't actually change what happened.

## Make a List of Everything You've Done Well

It's easier to focus on the things we've done wrong and forget about the things that we've done well.

## Recognize That Your Mistakes Can Teach You How to Do Better

If we never mess up, we can't learn how to do things better!

## Choose Small Things You Can Start Doing Now

Progress doesn't always have to mean making huge changes or reaching big goals. In fact, making progress often means making small, incremental changes that will lead you to a different circumstance.

## Work With a Professional

Whether it's a therapist, a coach, or a financial planner, sometimes you have to hire a professional. If you've tried to do the things I mentioned above, and you still can't relinquish your money shame, you might need someone to help you. If there are deep, painful issues that you need to work through, a therapist is probably your best bet. If you want to focus on moving forward and implementing solutions, a coach might be best. If you just want someone who will tell you exactly what to do with your money, a financial planner will probably help you the most.
