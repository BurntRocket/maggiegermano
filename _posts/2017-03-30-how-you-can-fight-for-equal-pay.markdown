Equal Pay Day is tomorrow, April 4th. Equal Pay Day is the symbolic day when the average American woman's earnings "catches up" to white men's earning from the previous year. Isn't it crazy to think that it takes women (on average) an extra three months to earn as much as a man did last year, for the same work?

I want to use this day to show you how you can work to close the wage gap in your own life.
